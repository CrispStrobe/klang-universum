// "Beatbox a beat": turns a raw mic feature trace into a Loop Mixer drum
// pattern. The screen records ~2 bars of PitchReadings (which carry rms +
// zcr on every frame); this finds onsets (energy jumps), classifies each hit
// as kick / snare / hat by brightness + low pitch, and quantizes onto the
// eighth-step grid. Pure Dart, headless-testable — the classification
// thresholds are calibrated against synth.dart's own renderDrum one-shots
// run through the real PitchDetector (kick zcr≈0.005 pitched-low ·
// snare≈0.45 · hat≈0.67; see test/beat_capture_test.dart).
