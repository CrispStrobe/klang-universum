// Run the pitch/chord analysis over a RECORDED audio file, not just the live
// mic. The detection core is already stream-based ([StreamingAudioAnalyzer]);
// this decodes a PCM16 WAV, downmixes to mono, and slides the analyzer across
// the whole recording at the FILE's own sample rate. Pure + Flutter-free, so
// both the app and `bin/listen.dart` share one tested implementation, and the
// detector hardening (non-finite/degenerate frames → silence) protects it.
