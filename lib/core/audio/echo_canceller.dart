// lib/core/audio/echo_canceller.dart
//
// A compact acoustic echo canceller (AEC) — the linear core of what Speex MDF
// and WebRTC AEC3 do. Given the reference signal that was played out and the
// mic signal that (partly) captured it back, it estimates the speaker→mic path
// with a constrained frequency-domain block adaptive filter (overlap-save FDAF
// with NLMS) and subtracts the predicted echo, leaving the near-end (the user).
//
// Pure Dart, reusing the FFT from chroma_analysis.dart. Fully testable with a
// perfectly aligned digital mix (see test/echo_canceller_test.dart). The
// deployment challenge is NOT the algorithm but sample-accurate alignment of
// reference and mic across Flutter's separate audio plugins — that needs a
// native full-duplex path (see PLAN.md, Tier 3b). This class is what such a
// path would feed. It is a LINEAR canceller: it has no double-talk detector or
// nonlinear/residual-suppression stage yet, so production robustness still comes
// from SpeexDSP/WebRTC.
