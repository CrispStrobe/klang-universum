// lib/core/audio/daw_timeline.dart
//
// The DAW timeline core — the "vector, not bitmap" model. A clip references a
// SOURCE (any module that renders offline to PCM — a groove, a score, a tracker
// song, a drum pattern, a raw sample), placed on a track at a start time. The
// mix is RASTERIZED ON DEMAND and cached per source, so editing a source model
// updates its clip without re-rendering the rest (like a vector object in a
// bitmap editor).
//
// This is an OFFLINE render-then-play DAW (the app has no realtime audio graph):
// `renderTimeline` bakes the whole arrangement to one PCM buffer, but the cache
// means only changed clips re-render, so re-baking after an edit stays cheap.
// Pure Dart, headless-testable; a DAW surface + per-module `ClipSource` adapters
// (GrooveSource, ScoreSource, TrackerSource, DrumSource, SampleSource) drive it.
