// Feedback-Delay-Network (FDN) reverb — a wide, smooth late-reverberator and a
// drop-in alternative to the Freeverb in reverb.dart. Pure Dart, Flutter-free,
// deterministic (no Random/DateTime), zero dependencies.
//
// The algorithm is standard, public DSP (Jot & Chaigne 1991; Stautner &
// Puckette; Julius O. Smith, *Physical Audio Signal Processing*, "Feedback
// Delay Networks"):
//
//   • N parallel delay lines whose lengths are mutually co-prime (primes), so
//     the echo pattern never repeats → a dense, non-metallic tail.
//   • A single UNITARY feedback matrix mixes every line's output back into every
//     line's input, so energy is conserved (stable) and the reverberation is
//     diffuse. We use a Householder reflection A = I − (2/N)·1·1ᵀ, evaluated on
//     the fly as y[i] = x[i] − (2/N)·Σx — no matrix storage, all lines coupled.
//   • The feedback is scaled by a global gain g < 1 that sets the decay time
//     (RT60), and each line is low-passed by a one-pole before feedback so highs
//     decay faster than lows — the "damping" of a real room's air/surfaces.
//   • The mono input is injected into all lines. The stereo output blends a
//     SHARED (mono) sum of all lines with a per-channel DECORRELATED component
//     (a disjoint, all-pass-phase-shifted half of the lines): out = a·mono +
//     b·decorr. The a:b ratio tunes the L/R correlation to the reference's
//     moderate, mono-SAFE width — WIDE but positively correlated, not phasey or
//     cancelling in mono (the whole point of an FDN over a mono reverb).
