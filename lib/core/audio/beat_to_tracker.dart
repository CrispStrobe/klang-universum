// Builds a polyphonic drum [TrackerSong] from a shared beat: one percussion
// channel per active drum, so kick + hat on the same step just live on two
// channels (a tracker channel is monophonic per step). Used by the Advanced
// Tracker's "Load shared beat" — it can carry the full beat losslessly, unlike
// the Beginner Tracker's single 3-voice drum channel.
//
// Pure Dart → unit-tested in test/beat_to_tracker_test.dart.
