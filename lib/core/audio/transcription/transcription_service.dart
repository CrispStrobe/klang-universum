// N2 — the app-facing orchestration for "transcribe a recording": WAV bytes → a
// crisp_notation Score, ready to open in the Song Book or Composition Workshop.
//
// Pure and web-safe: it wires the auto-router (route.dart) → rhythm (rhythm.dart)
// → the S5 engraver (transcribe.dart, which uses crisp_notation_core, not the
// Flutter barrel). The NEURAL engine is INJECTED as a [NeuralTranscriber] — this
// file never imports basic_pitch (which pulls dart:io), so it compiles on web,
// where the caller passes `neural: null` and the router uses the monophonic
// chain. The app supplies the real Basic Pitch transcriber on native when its
// model is present.
