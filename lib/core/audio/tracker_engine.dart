// lib/core/audio/tracker_engine.dart
//
// Pure-Dart pattern-sequencer engine behind the Tracker (a touch-first take on
// ModEdit / FastTracker 2 / Scream Tracker 3 / Impulse Tracker). A tracker is
// the Loop Mixer with an EDITABLE grid: each channel is a column of cells
// (one per row/step); rendering sums the channels through the same
// offline-mix-then-loop path the Loop Mixer uses (mixStems -> one seamless WAV,
// one player, sample-accurate sync). Flutter-free, like synth.dart /
// loop_engine.dart — unit-tested without a device.
//
// Slice 0 ships ADDITIVE instruments only (the built-in synth timbres). The
// [TrackerInstrument] abstraction is the seam where sfxr-generated and
// recorded/effected sample instruments plug in later (see
// docs/TRACKER_HANDOVER.md) without changing the engine.
