// lib/core/services/gapless_loop_player.dart
//
// A two-player looping channel that swaps buffers without the silent hiccup a
// single-player stop→play causes. On each swap it starts the new buffer on the
// IDLE player at the requested phase, and only then stops the outgoing player —
// so the two briefly overlap on the same audio at the same position instead of
// leaving a gap. No timers (they'd leave pending timers under flutter_test); the
// overlap is just the play() call's own latency. Same guarded ethos as
// LoopPlayerService — audio failures are swallowed so tests / audioless
// platforms never break. Drop-in compatible with LoopPlayerService's API.
