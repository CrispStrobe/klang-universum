// lib/core/services/voice_pool.dart
//
// A small pool of audio voices for POLYPHONIC one-shot playback. The shared
// AudioService is monophonic — it `stop()`s whatever is sounding before every
// play — so tapping two keys cuts the first one off. A VoicePool round-robins
// across N players and stops only the voice it reuses, so a kid can hold a
// chord or let notes ring (sustain) on the Perform keyboard/pads.
//
// Like LoopPlayerService, the players are created LAZILY on first play (so
// headless tests never touch the plugin) and every failure is swallowed —
// audio is juice, never a requirement.
