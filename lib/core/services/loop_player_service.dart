// Gapless-looping playback channel for the Loop Mixer. Deliberately a second,
// dedicated AudioPlayer — AudioService's shared SFX player stops whatever is
// sounding on every play, so a feedback blip anywhere would kill the groove
// (and the groove would eat SFX). Like AudioService, playback failures are
// swallowed: audio is juice, never a requirement — tests and platforms
// without audio must not break.
