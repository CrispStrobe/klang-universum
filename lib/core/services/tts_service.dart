// Text-to-speech narration for the lessons/primers (and, later, game how-to
// text). A pre-reader (6–8yo) can HEAR a lesson before they can read it, and it
// makes the app accessible.
//
// Design: the plugin (`flutter_tts` — platform AVSpeechSynthesizer / Android TTS
// / web SpeechSynthesis, all on-device + offline + free) sits behind a
// [TtsBackend] interface, so (a) tests inject a fake with no method channel, and
// (b) a higher-quality neural backend (CrispTTS / Kokoro-ONNX via
// onnx_runtime_dart) can slot in later without touching call sites. This is the
// ONLY file that imports the TTS plugin.
//
// Narration follows the master sound switch ([soundOn], mirrored from
// SettingsService like AudioService): sound off ⇒ the app is silent, narration
// included. Speaking is best-effort — a platform with no voice for the locale
// just stays quiet rather than throwing.
