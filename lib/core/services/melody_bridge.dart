// MelodyBridge — the pitched twin of BeatBridge. One in-memory "current tune"
// that modes can PUBLISH to and PULL from, so the Loop Mixer, Live Looper and
// the Trackers can hand the SAME melody around: build it in one, load it in
// another. The unit is a bar-cycle of [PatternCell]s (the melodic pattern the
// engine already renders) plus the instrument it was voiced with and the
// tempo/key it was authored at.
//
// Like BeatBridge: a plain singleton (screens are navigated one at a time, so
// an explicit publish/pull is the right model), listenable via [melody]. Pure
// Dart (only depends on the loop-engine model) → unit-tested.
