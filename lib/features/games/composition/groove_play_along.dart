// Groove → PlayAlongChart: the "follow the melody" bridge for jam mode (Loop
// Mixer follow-ups §B, the deferred per-note grading). The groove's cells are
// data on an eighth-step grid (loop_engine.dart), so turning one track into a
// PlayAlong target is a pure mapping — each pitched cell becomes a TargetNote
// in musical time, rests are gaps, and PlayAlongEngine (with a practice loop
// over the whole chart) grades the player pass after looping pass, exactly the
// way Play Along / Sing Along already grade a fixed tune.
//
// Pure and Flutter-free; unit-tested against synthetic cells.
