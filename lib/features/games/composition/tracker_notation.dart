// The notation bridge (Tracker → Score): turns a tracker channel's pattern into
// a real crisp_notation Score, so the grid can be shown as staff notation — the
// "score view" of the tracker (and the link to the Workshop). Reuses the
// grid_composer idea (grid → Score) generalized to the tracker's held notes and
// step resolution.
//
// Fidelity: a channel is monophonic, so this is near-lossless — held runs become
// tied notes decomposed into standard values, split at 4/4 bar lines. The
// reverse (Score → Tracker) is inherently partial (quantize + monophonic-per-
// channel + scale-snap) and is a later slice.
