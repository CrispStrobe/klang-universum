// Groove → crisp_notation Score: the Loop Mixer's live-engraving bridge (the
// app's signature "you're quietly writing notation" trick, scaled up from
// Colour Melody). Pattern cells are data (loop_engine.dart), so engraving is
// a pure mapping: eighth-note steps → note/rest durations, 8 steps per 4/4
// bar, cells split at barlines.
