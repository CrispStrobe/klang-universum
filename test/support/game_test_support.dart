// Shared harness for game-screen widget tests.
//
// Staff-based game screens stack one or more engraved staves in a Column. On
// CI's small default test surface (800×600, Linux glyph metrics) those staves
// can overflow and render off-screen, so `tap`/`drag`/`ensureVisible` throw
// `getElementPoint` — even though the same test passes locally (macOS, larger
// effective metrics). This got worse as crisp_notation's rendering evolved
// under mus CI, which tracks `crisp_notation@main`.
//
// Use [useGameSurface] (or [pumpGame], which calls it) in every staff-based
// game test so the whole screen is laid out with room to spare and its targets
// stay tappable on any platform. See docs/PLAN.md board note.
