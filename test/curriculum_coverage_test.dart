// Coverage gap analysis over the grade-1–10 concept inventory vs the real game
// registry. Prints the gap report (the planning artefact) and guards the hard
// invariants: no concept may reference a game that doesn't exist, and every
// concept's game ids must be real. The "untrained"/"thin"/"orphan" lists are
// informational — they are the map of where our coverage is thin.
