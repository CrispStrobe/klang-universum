# Automatic Play-Along — plan & status

Live pitch/chord detection from the mic, turned into real practice modes:
tuner, sing-along, play-along with a moving score, and games. Everything sits
on one pure-Dart detection core so it stays testable headlessly and from a CLI.

## Architecture (done, `feature/pitch-detection-spike`)

```
mic (record plugin) ─┐
WAV file ────────────┼─→ StreamingAudioAnalyzer ─→ PitchReading  (mono, MPM/NSDF)
stdin PCM (CLI) ─────┘        (sliding window)   └─→ ChordReading  (chromagram+templates)
```

- `core/audio/pitch_analysis.dart` — McLeod Pitch Method detector → note + cents.
- `core/audio/chroma_analysis.dart` — FFT + chromagram + fuzzy chord templates.
- `core/audio/streaming_analyzer.dart` — pure-Dart windowing, shared by mic + CLI.
- `core/audio/microphone_pitch_service.dart` — the only plugin-facing file.
- `core/audio/wav_io.dart` — PCM16 WAV reader.
- `bin/listen.dart` — CLI: `--wav`, `--stdin` (live), `--selftest`, `--chords`.
- `core/audio/play_along.dart` — scoring engine for play/sing-along (see below).

Detectors are proven headlessly (synth-based unit tests, all green) and via the
CLI on real audio; the mic path is verified on macOS. Only the live *acoustic*
feel (latency, real-instrument chord accuracy) still wants on-device tuning.

## Modes & games

### 1. Tuner — DONE (real)
Chromatic/cello tuner: big note, cents needle, in-tune zone. Cello-first
(fretless intonation is where it matters). Keeper tile.

### 2. Play-along (moving score) — DONE
Target notes are scored against your live pitch (correct pitch within a cents
window for enough of a note's duration = hit); `PlayAlongEngine` is pure-Dart
and unit-tested. **Four switchable scroll views** (a menu in the app bar):
highway (piano-roll), falling (vertical), notation (real engraved staff +
moving cursor, via partitura), and coach (big current/next note for beginners).
Cello/guitar/keyboard charts + count-in metronome.

### 3. Sing-along — DONE (v1)
The same engine + screen with a vocal-range melody preset. Voice is the same
monophonic detection; only the chart/labelling differs.

### 4. Chord listener — DONE (spike)
Names the chord you strum/play with runner-up guesses + a chroma bar chart.

### 5. Chord-progression play-along — DONE
A moving chord chart (C–G–Am–F): strum the progression as it scrolls; each
chord is scored by the fuzzy ChordDetector (`ChordProgressionEngine`, top-2
lenient match). Records to ProgressService + stars. Validated end-to-end via
the BlackHole loop — all four roots detected on real captured audio (the
7th/maj7 variants are expected overtone pickup, hence the lenient match).

## Known constraints / follow-ups (not yet done)
- **Backing audio vs. mic (AEC):** see the dedicated section below — count-in
  metronome + optional backing (tiers 0/1) shipped; a Dart AEC core is the next
  step; a native full-duplex plugin is the production fix.
- **Localization:** DONE — the four modes have de/en `AppLocalizations` keys,
  and the tuner/chord/play-along note readouts respect the note-naming setting
  (German H, solfège) via `spelledMidiName`. Chart names + the Hz/clarity
  readout stay language-neutral.
- **Progress/stars:** DONE — play/sing/guitar/keyboard play-along record to
  `ProgressService` (score = notes hit) with `kStarThresholds` brackets and a
  `GameResultView` (stars + Play again) on finish.
- **Real-instrument tuning:** validated end-to-end through the real macOS audio
  stack via a **BlackHole loopback** self-test (sox plays a scale to the
  BlackHole *output* device; ffmpeg captures the BlackHole *input*; the CLI
  detects it). Recovered a full C-major scale within a few cents — thresholds
  held on real captured audio, no retune needed. Reproduce:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":<BlackHole idx>" -t 8 -ar 44100 -ac 1 bh.wav &
  sox scale.wav -t coreaudio "BlackHole 2ch"          # non-intrusive; default device untouched
  dart run bin/listen.dart --wav bh.wav
  ```
  Still worth a pass with a *real acoustic instrument* into a physical mic.
- **Phase 3 (full polyphonic transcription):** still out of scope; would layer
  on the same chromagram.

## Backing audio & echo cancellation (AEC)

Goal: play audible backing through the speaker *during* play/sing-along without
the mic grading the speaker. Two corrections shape the design:
1. **Pitch-domain gating is self-defeating here.** In play-along the user
   *matches* the backing, so echo and desired signal share the same pitch — you
   can't gate "the backing's pitch" without gating the user. Real cancellation
   must be **waveform-domain** (subtract a reference-derived echo estimate).
2. **A pure-Dart AEC starves on alignment.** `audioplayers` (out) and `record`
   (in) are two plugins on two clocks — no shared timebase. The *algorithm*
   ports fine (we have an FFT); the *deployment* needs sample-accurate ref+mic,
   which only an OS-integrated or native full-duplex path provides.

### Tiers
- **Tier 0 — headphones (DONE).** No acoustic coupling → backing works with zero
  AEC and zero pitch loss. Backing toggle plays the melody at the downbeat;
  label says "use headphones". The clean answer for real practice.
- **Tier 1 — platform AEC (DONE).** Backing toggle also flips on
  `RecordConfig.echoCancel` (iOS VoiceProcessingIO / Android VOICE_COMMUNICATION
  / macOS voice-processing). Real OS AEC, but its AGC/NS reshape the waveform and
  cost pitch accuracy. **Needs on-device measurement** (can't be tested via the
  BlackHole digital loopback — no speaker→mic path).
- **Tier 2 — Dart pitch gate: SKIPPED** (self-defeating for play-along, per #1).
- **Tier 3a — Dart AEC core (IN PROGRESS).** `core/audio/echo_canceller.dart`: a
  compact **constrained frequency-domain block-NLMS** echo canceller (the linear
  core of Speex MDF / WebRTC AEC3), reusing the FFT. Testable headlessly with a
  perfectly-aligned digital mix (ERLE assertion). Deployment still needs Tier 3b
  to feed it aligned ref+mic.
- **Tier 3b — native full-duplex plugin (FUTURE).** One native audio engine that
  owns playback+capture on a shared clock and runs a real AEC. This is the
  production fix. Build host: **miniaudio** (public-domain/MIT-0) or **Oboe**
  (Android, Apache-2.0) / **AVAudioEngine** (Apple). AEC: **SpeexDSP MDF** (BSD)
  or **WebRTC AEC3** / `webrtc-audio-processing` (BSD). Days–weeks.
- **Tier 4 — neural (IF NEEDED).** `DTLN-aec` (MIT, TFLite, tiny, on-device) or
  `DeepFilterNet` (MIT/Apache). Watch: speech-trained nets may not preserve a
  sung/played note's *pitch*.

### Permissive libraries (all BSD/MIT/Apache — usable or portable)

## Testing
- `flutter test` — unit tests for every detector + the play-along engine.
- `dart run bin/listen.dart --selftest --chords` — headless smoke test.
- `dart run bin/listen.dart --stdin` fed from `sox`/`ffmpeg` — live mic.
- macOS/iOS builds need the GEM-env wrapper (see CLAUDE.md / appstore.md).
