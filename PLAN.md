# Automatic Play-Along — plan & status

🚧 **Idle / Last-shipped (Agent checkpoint)**
- Shipped: Real-time Oscilloscopes & Meters per-channel in Tracker (Beginner + Advanced).

Live pitch/chord detection from the mic, turned into real practice modes:
tuner, sing-along, play-along with a moving score, and games. Everything sits
on one pure-Dart detection core so it stays testable headlessly and from a CLI.

## Sound Library / Instrument / FX unification (IN PROGRESS)

Unify the places that currently drift apart: the Tracker instrument selector,
Workshop Score "Play with an instrument", Audio Editor track/clip voicing, and
Sound Library creation tools.

- **One Sound Library surface for instruments.** Built-in Tracker voices
  (Tonal / Plucked / Chiptune / Drums / Recorded), saved instruments/samples,
  SoundFont-backed voices, catalog installs, and generated FX must all be
  available from the same picker. Any screen that says "choose an instrument"
  should open that picker, not a separate chip-only palette.
- **Generate FX creates instruments.** SFXR/FX generation belongs inside the
  Sound Library creation menu so generated FX can become playable instruments in
  Tracker, Workshop Score playback, and Audio Editor score/track voicing. It
  should not be hidden behind Audio Editor > Add clip as a one-off timeline
  source.
- **Add clip adds timeline material.** Audio Editor > Add clip should stay about
  arranging clips: samples from the library, extracted/imported material, and
  demo beat/tune. Sound design tools live in the Sound Library when the goal is
  creating/selecting an instrument.
- **Voice Shaping is an audio FX module.** Shape a Voice is no longer an "add a
  clip" action. The voice-shaping DSP should be exposed under Audio Editor FX so
  it can process any WAV/sample/track/segment. Today that means a Voice Shaping
  section in track inserts; later it can grow clip/segment modules and more FX
  sections without changing the instrument picker model.

## Tab Editor navigation (DONE)

- Add a three-dot overflow menu to the Tab Editor and move lower-frequency
  actions out of the crowded top bar.
- Keep transport, import, save, and primary editing controls immediately
  reachable; put inspect mode, clear/reset, and future utility actions in the
  overflow menu.
- Ensure every menu action has an explicit effect in the editable tab document,
  rather than only changing a label or preview.

Implemented in `7e05bd55`, `62efa301` and covered by `test/tab_workshop_test.dart`:
the overflow menu owns utility actions, chord picking changes voicing/playback,
and the no-op Demo riff action was removed.

## Architecture (done, `feature/pitch-detection-spike`)

```
mic (record plugin) ─┐
WAV file ────────────┼─→ StreamingAudioAnalyzer ─→ PitchReading  (mono, MPM/NSDF)
stdin PCM (CLI) ─────┘        (sliding window)   └─→ ChordReading  (chromagram+templates)
```

- `core/audio/pitch_analysis.dart` — McLeod Pitch Method detector → note + cents.
- `core/audio/chroma_analysis.dart` — FFT + chromagram + fuzzy chord templates.
- `core/audio/streaming_analyzer.dart` — pure-Dart windowing, shared by mic + CLI.
- `core/audio/microphone_pitch_service.dart` — the only plugin-facing file.
- `core/audio/wav_io.dart` — PCM16 WAV reader.
- `bin/listen.dart` — CLI: `--wav`, `--stdin` (live), `--selftest`, `--chords`.
- `core/audio/play_along.dart` — scoring engine for play/sing-along (see below).

Detectors are proven headlessly (synth-based unit tests, all green) and via the
CLI on real audio; the mic path is verified on macOS. Only the live *acoustic*
feel (latency, real-instrument chord accuracy) still wants on-device tuning.

## Modes & games

### 1. Tuner — DONE (real)
Chromatic/cello tuner: big note, cents needle, in-tune zone. Cello-first
(fretless intonation is where it matters). Keeper tile.

### 2. Play-along (moving score) — DONE
Target notes are scored against your live pitch (correct pitch within a cents
window for enough of a note's duration = hit); `PlayAlongEngine` is pure-Dart
and unit-tested. **Four switchable scroll views** (a menu in the app bar):
highway (piano-roll), falling (vertical), notation (real engraved staff +
moving cursor, via crisp_notation), and coach (big current/next note for beginners).
Cello/guitar/keyboard charts + count-in metronome.

### 3. Sing-along — DONE (v1)
The same engine + screen with a vocal-range melody preset. Voice is the same
monophonic detection; only the chart/labelling differs.

### 4. Chord listener — DONE (spike)
Names the chord you strum/play with runner-up guesses + a chroma bar chart.

### 5. Chord-progression play-along — DONE
A moving chord chart (C–G–Am–F): strum the progression as it scrolls; each
chord is scored by the fuzzy ChordDetector (`ChordProgressionEngine`, top-2
lenient match). Records to ProgressService + stars. Validated end-to-end via
the BlackHole loop — all four roots detected on real captured audio (the
7th/maj7 variants are expected overtone pickup, hence the lenient match).

## Songbook — scan sheet music into playable songs (PLANNED)

Product feature, not a detector: let the user build **songbooks** from real sheet
music. Flow: import/scan a score photo → **Optical Music Recognition** → notation
→ store as a song the existing play-along/notation modes can drive → group songs
into named collections (browse / search / reorder / export).

- **OMR engine — reuse CrispEmbed, don't rebuild.** `CrispEmbed` already ships
  two validated OMR engines with Dart FFI bindings (`CrispEmbedOmr`): **SMT**
  (printed pianoform → bekern) and **Polyphonic-TrOMR** (printed/camera-robust →
  rhythm/pitch/lift → symbolic notation, `cstr/tromr-GGUF`). Auto-detected from
  the GGUF; a plain photo of a staff system works. So this app consumes those
  GGUFs via the FFI wrapper rather than porting any model here.
- **Scope TBD:** persistence format (song = source image + recognized notation +
  metadata), per-song metadata (title/composer/key/tempo), collection model,
  and an edit/re-run flow for correcting recognition mistakes before it becomes a
  chart. Bridge OMR notation → the app's internal note/chart representation that
  `PlayAlongEngine` / the `crisp_notation` notation view already consume.
- Flagged here so the OMR work in CrispEmbed and this app's songbook UI stay
  aligned; sequencing vs. the AEC/backing work is open.

## Known constraints / follow-ups (not yet done)
- **Backing audio vs. mic (AEC):** see the dedicated section below — count-in
  metronome + optional backing (tiers 0/1) shipped; a Dart AEC core is the next
  step; a native full-duplex plugin is the production fix.
- **Localization:** DONE — the four modes have de/en `AppLocalizations` keys,
  and the tuner/chord/play-along note readouts respect the note-naming setting
  (German H, solfège) via `spelledMidiName`. Chart names + the Hz/clarity
  readout stay language-neutral.
- **Progress/stars:** DONE — play/sing/guitar/keyboard play-along record to
  `ProgressService` (score = notes hit) with `kStarThresholds` brackets and a
  `GameResultView` (stars + Play again) on finish.
- **Real-instrument tuning:** validated end-to-end through the real macOS audio
  stack via a **BlackHole loopback** self-test (sox plays a scale to the
  BlackHole *output* device; ffmpeg captures the BlackHole *input*; the CLI
  detects it). Recovered a full C-major scale within a few cents — thresholds
  held on real captured audio, no retune needed. Reproduce:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":<BlackHole idx>" -t 8 -ar 44100 -ac 1 bh.wav &
  sox scale.wav -t coreaudio "BlackHole 2ch"          # non-intrusive; default device untouched
  dart run bin/listen.dart --wav bh.wav
  ```
  **Robustness characterized** headlessly (`test/pitch_robustness_test.dart`):
  the detector holds pitch through ±20-cent 5-6 Hz **vibrato** (within 25¢), never
  reports a WRONG note as **noise** rises (it gives up gracefully, surviving to
  ≥0.25 noise amplitude), detects soft (pp) dynamics while gating out silence,
  and stays on the fundamental for **rich/bright timbres** (no octave errors).

  **The real-acoustic-instrument-into-a-physical-mic pass is human-gated** (needs
  someone to actually play). On-device protocol:
  1. Cello/guitar/voice → open the **Tuner**; sustain each open string / a sung
     note. Expect the right note, needle steady, cents within a few of a
     reference tuner.
  2. **Play along** a slow chart (½× tempo); confirm hits register and the live
     dot tracks. 3. **Chord listener**: strum open chords; confirm the top guess.
  4. Note failure modes (bow noise, breath, room reverb, low SNR) for tuning
     `clarityThreshold`/`energyGate` against real signal.
- **Phase 3 (full polyphonic transcription):** still out of scope; would layer
  on the same chromagram.

## Backing audio & echo cancellation (AEC)

Goal: play audible backing through the speaker *during* play/sing-along without
the mic grading the speaker. Two corrections shape the design:
1. **Pitch-domain gating is self-defeating here.** In play-along the user
   *matches* the backing, so echo and desired signal share the same pitch — you
   can't gate "the backing's pitch" without gating the user. Real cancellation
   must be **waveform-domain** (subtract a reference-derived echo estimate).
2. **A pure-Dart AEC starves on alignment.** `audioplayers` (out) and `record`
   (in) are two plugins on two clocks — no shared timebase. The *algorithm*
   ports fine (we have an FFT); the *deployment* needs sample-accurate ref+mic,
   which only an OS-integrated or native full-duplex path provides.

### Tiers
- **Tier 0 — headphones (DONE).** No acoustic coupling → backing works with zero
  AEC and zero pitch loss. Backing toggle plays the melody at the downbeat;
  label says "use headphones". The clean answer for real practice.
- **Tier 1 — platform AEC (DONE).** Backing toggle also flips on
  `RecordConfig.echoCancel` (iOS VoiceProcessingIO / Android VOICE_COMMUNICATION
  / macOS voice-processing). Real OS AEC, but its AGC/NS reshape the waveform and
  cost pitch accuracy. **Needs on-device measurement** (can't be tested via the
  BlackHole digital loopback — no speaker→mic path).
- **Tier 2 — Dart pitch gate: SKIPPED** (self-defeating for play-along, per #1).
- **Tier 3a — Dart AEC core (IN PROGRESS).** `core/audio/echo_canceller.dart`: a
  compact **constrained frequency-domain block-NLMS** echo canceller (the linear
  core of Speex MDF / WebRTC AEC3), reusing the FFT. Testable headlessly with a
  perfectly-aligned digital mix (ERLE assertion). Deployment still needs Tier 3b
  to feed it aligned ref+mic.
- **Tier 3b — native full-duplex plugin (DESIGNED, not started in code).** One
  native audio engine that owns playback+capture on a shared clock and runs a
  real AEC. This is the production fix. Full architecture, Dart API, per-platform
  build, CI-safety rules and verification plan: **[AEC_TIER3B.md](AEC_TIER3B.md)**.
  Stack: **miniaudio** (MIT-0, full-duplex host) + **SpeexDSP** (BSD, the AEC).
  Days–weeks; must be built in an isolated branch and kept out of the app's
  pubspec until it compiles green on all 5 CI platforms.
- **Tier 4 — neural (IF NEEDED).** `DTLN-aec` (MIT, TFLite, tiny, on-device) or
  `DeepFilterNet` (MIT/Apache). Watch: speech-trained nets may not preserve a
  sung/played note's *pitch*.

### Permissive libraries (all BSD/MIT/Apache — usable or portable)
SpeexDSP echo canceller (BSD, port/FFI) · WebRTC AEC3 / webrtc-audio-processing
(BSD, FFI) · DTLN-aec (MIT, TFLite) · DeepFilterNet (MIT/Apache) · miniaudio
(MIT-0) · Oboe (Apache) · KISS FFT / PFFFT (BSD).

## Testing
- `flutter test` — unit tests for every detector + the play-along engine.
- `dart run bin/listen.dart --selftest --chords` — headless smoke test.
- `dart run bin/listen.dart --stdin` fed from `sox`/`ffmpeg` — live mic.
- macOS/iOS builds need the GEM-env wrapper (see CLAUDE.md / appstore.md).

## Advanced Tracker module: Feature Gap Analysis & Roadmap

To evolve our tracker into a world-class, perfect UX environment (drawing visual and workflow inspiration from DefleMask, but avoiding the rigid hardware-emulator path), we must focus on universal instrument support, seamless ecosystem interchangeability, and power-user ergonomics.

### 1. Universal Instrument Ecosystem & Editing
**Current State:** 
Our `TrackerInstrument` hierarchy (`AdditiveInstrument`, `SfxrInstrument`, `SampleInstrument`) is robust but lacks a unified, deep editing UI. We want to support all kinds of sounds interchangeably without forcing hardware constraints.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Instrument Editor Overlay:** Create `instrument_editor.dart` inside the Studio UI with a real-time testing keyboard.
2. **Sample Editor:** For `SampleInstrument`, build a waveform viewer with draggable handles for `loopStart`/`loopLength`, ping-pong toggles, and base MIDI tuning.
3. **Synth & FX Editor:** For `SfxrInstrument` or FM models, embed the existing `lib/features/sound_lab/sound_lab_screen.dart` to expose its rich slider UI directly in the tracker.
4. **Multi-Sample Groundwork:** Enable `MultiSampleInstrument` to map different sample IDs across the keyboard (essential for complex DrumKits and realistic acoustic patches).

### 2. Ecosystem Interchangeability (Workshop, Looper, DrumKit, Tab)
**Current State:**
We have `tracker_notation.dart` bridging Tracker ↔ Score Workshop. However, deep integration with other DAW tools (Looper, Tab Editor, DrumKit) is missing. 

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Looper / Loop Mixer Bridge:** Implement a function to bake a Tracker pattern directly into a `LoopTrack` stem (`Float64List`) so it can be dropped into the Loop Mixer as a perfectly-timed, loopable clip.
2. **DrumKit Bridge:** Ensure `PercussionInstrument` directly reads from/writes to the same model used by the standalone DrumKit view. A beat tapped out physically in the DrumKit must instantly populate the Tracker's percussion channel.
3. **Tab Editor Translation:** Expand `tracker_notation.dart` to support translating plucked string channels (`KarplusInstrument`) into Tab Editor strings, mapping MIDI pitches to string/fret combinations based on tuning.

### 3. Visual Excellence & Workflow (The "DefleMask" Feel)
**Current State:**
The Studio UI (`tracker_screen.dart`) is functional but lacks the slick, real-time visual feedback and rapid navigation of elite modern trackers.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ~~**Real-time Oscilloscopes & Meters:**~~ Tap the `_stem(channel)` cache in `TrackerEngine`. Pass this data to an `OscilloscopeWidget` using `CustomPainter` to draw vivid, real-time waveforms and VU meters per channel, exactly like DefleMask. (DONE)
2. **Smooth Scrolling Matrix:** Evolve the grid rendering to support pixel-smooth playhead scrolling (rather than rigid row-by-row jumping) and a dynamic pattern matrix where channel loops can be visualized block-by-block.
3. **Advanced Keyboard Handling:** Add `FocusNode` and `KeyEvent` handlers for lightning-fast multi-cell selection (shift+arrows), cross-channel copy/paste, and value interpolation directly in the grid.

### 4. Deep Instrument Modulation (Macros & Envelopes)
**Current State:**
Instruments are static per note run, lacking tick-level modulators.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Macro Data Model:** Create a `MacroSequence` class for Volume, Panning, Pitch, and Arpeggio envelopes.
2. **Tick-level Rendering:** Transition `mixStems` and `renderChannel` to evaluate notes tick-by-tick, updating the instrument's active frequency and amplitude based on the `MacroSequence`.

### 5. Comprehensive Effect Command Set & Flow Control
**Current State:**
`TrackerCell` holds hex `fxCmd/fxParam`, but we currently only process volume commands. 

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Unify Pitch Effects:** Move arpeggio/porta/vibrato from the `TrackerEffect` enum into the hex pipeline, evaluating them tick-by-tick during `renderChannel`.
2. **Flow & Groove Commands:** Support Speed (`Fxx`), Pattern Break (`Dxx`), and Position Jump (`Bxx`). Rewrite `renderSong` as a dynamic state machine that respects these navigation commands.
3. **Sub-row Timing:** Implement Note Delay (`EDx`) and Note Cut (`ECx`) directly in the offline renderer to allow complex swing and ghost notes.
