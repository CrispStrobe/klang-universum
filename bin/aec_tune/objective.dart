//
// The objective an automatic tuner maximizes — deliberately DOMAIN-appropriate,
// not the industry's speech-MOS. Per docs/LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md we
// judge by the decoded outcome ("does the detector still hear the instrument?"),
// not by AEC-internal numbers. So a config's score combines:
//
//   * note-survival — after cancellation, does the pitch detector read the
//     near-end's true note over the double-talk region? This is the thing the
//     app actually needs, and the guardrail against a config that maximizes echo
//     removal by chewing the near-end.
//   * SI-SDR (dB) of the cleaned output vs the KNOWN true near-end over the
//     double-talk region — the gain-invariant fidelity of what survived.
//
// Score = mean SI-SDR + kNoteBonus * (fraction of scenarios whose note survived).
// Higher is better. SI-SDR carries the fine gradient; the note bonus dominates
// when a config starts destroying the signal, steering the search back.
