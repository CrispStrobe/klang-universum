# KlangUniversum — Shipped history

The record of what's been built and lives in production
([mus-theta.vercel.app](https://mus-theta.vercel.app)). Forward-looking work —
what's pending and planned — lives in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md); this file is the
changelog it graduated from.

## Progression

- **Stars persist** (`ProgressService`): best stars/score and play count per
  game, shown on every game tile.
- **Star-driven difficulty**: 2+ stars widen a game's material (reading
  games gain the ledger range incl. middle C; Scale Detective gains D and A
  major; Measure Filler gains sixteenths). More expansions per game over
  time — SM-2 mastery stays the long-term signal, stars the session signal.
- **Soft unlock gating**: a module unlocks once the *previous* one has
  ≥ `kModuleUnlockTracked` SRI-tracked items (the child genuinely played
  there). Engagement gate, not a mastery gate — mastery gating proved too
  slow for a 6-year-old's first week. Locked cards explain what to play
  first.

## Audio (v1)

`core/audio/synth.dart` synthesizes everything in pure Dart — no assets, no
licensing: piano-ish additive tones (pitches, chords, arpeggios, sequences)
rendered to WAV and played via `audioplayers` (data-URI source on web), plus
CrispFXR-style retro square-wave SFX (correct blip, wrong buzz, fanfare —
same procedural approach as the maintainer's
[CrispFXR](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispFXR-web) /
[crispaudio](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crispaudio) projects, in Dart).
`AudioService` wires it app-wide; feedback sounds run centrally through
`QuizRoundMixin`. First ear game shipped: Major-or-Minor.

**Selectable instrument voices:** the synth carries four timbres — piano, a
reedy sustained **cello**, a soft **flute**, and a bright fast-decaying **music
box** — each a distinct harmonic profile + attack/decay. Settings has an
instrument picker (icon chips, previews on tap); the choice persists and drives
all pitched playback app-wide (retro SFX unchanged).

## Composition Workshop

A section *outside* the minigames (home-bar piano button) — a small real score
editor. Pick a time signature (2/4 · 3/4 · 4/4, bar-lines drawn automatically),
pick a note value (whole/half/quarter/eighth), tap the staff to write, tap a
note to select it and re-pitch or delete it, hear it back with real durations,
and save to the Song Book as MusicXML. The Capella-like grown-up sibling of the
My Melody sandbox.

## Playtest cycle — polish, reworks & tools

A full parent/child playtest pass. Grouped by kind.

**Correctness & UX fixes:** Symbol Quiz renders note/rest **on a staff** (rests
now identifiable) · Rhythm Echo **sounds from the first tap**, rings while held ·
Sort the Beats — much **larger bucket glyphs** + the bottom **mascot reacts** ·
Connect columns pulled **close together** · Line or Space is **tappable** (+
arrow keys), not swipe-only · Falling Notes **starts ~half speed** · Triad
Builder is a **single measure** (taps land where the note appears) · My Melody
uses an **adaptive clef** (a cello's low C shows in bass) · Song Book karaoke
highlight **no longer drifts** behind the audio · Cello "Which String?" is scoped
to the **open strings** (unambiguous).

**Pedagogy reworks** (games that "made no sense"): **Follow the Conductor** →
real **conducting patterns** (metre/downbeat) · **Beat Runner** → a **rhythm-
reading lane** (note-value markers spaced by their true durations) · **Scale
Detective / Builder** → harder, into **minor keys** (harmonic minor defeats the
spot-the-accidental shortcut) · **Sound Echo** → noteheads on the pads with
**cues that fade** (colour → sound → read alone).

**Deeper features:** Melody Echo **lights notes L→R** as a card plays · Melody
Dictation **edit-in-place** (tap a note to re-pitch/delete) · **bass-clef
variants** of Line or Space, Note Order, Falling Notes and Connect (violin +
bass, own SRI + stars) · **keyboard control** app-wide (number keys select any
answer grid; arrow keys drive Line or Space & the Conductor; space/enter the
rhythm lane; C–B letter keys catch Falling Notes) · **Progress "tricky spots"**
now shows every skill (coloured module icons, skill-typed labels), not just
notes · **Tenor Clef reading** is gated as an advanced unlock — the tile shows
locked until the child has 2★ in both other Cello-Corner games (a general
per-game `unlockedWhen` gate on `GameInfo`).

## Opportunity backlog — shipped

- **Note-naming toggle:** German H/B, English, solfège — one setting, every
  drill. Reinforces EN/DE.
- **Daily streak + practice calendar** (flame + count + 7-day dots on home;
  finishing a game marks the day).
- **"Wait mode" pacing** — advance only on the correct answer, no timed fail
  (`QuizRoundMixin` retries until correct, no timers/lives anywhere); guarded
  by a contract test.
- **Reacting mascot** — a pure-Dart quarter-note character in the shared
  feedback line: hops + grins on correct, damped wobble + "oops" on wrong;
  reduced-motion aware.
- **Opt-in timer + beat-your-time** — off by default; when on, the result
  screen shows completion time + personal best + "new best!" (no live clock).
- **Bilingual EN/DE pedagogy** foregrounded — the note-naming toggle advances
  it in-app; the rest is positioning.
- **Weak-spot ear engine + "your tricky notes"** — `SriService.weakestItems`
  + a card on the Progress screen with readable labels; SM-2 re-drills them.
- **Functional cadence → scale-degree ear mode** — "Hear the Function"
  (harmony): a I–IV–V–I cadence establishes the key by ear, then a target
  chord is named T/S/D. SRI `harmony.hear.*`, review-routed.
- **Landmark / intervallic reading hints (fading)** — the Reading Quiz shows a
  landmark chip ("a skip up from E") anchoring on memorized lines + middle C;
  fades with mastery (gone at 3★ and in review). `reading_hint.dart`.
- **Written melodic dictation** — **Melody Dictation**: a melody plays (audio
  only), the child writes it by tapping noteheads onto the InteractiveStaff,
  per-note feedback + undo + note-for-note check. SRI
  `note_reading.dictation.len3`. (Rhythm dictation served by Rhythm Echo.)
- **Removable colour scaffold** — Settings toggle "Colour helper for beginners"
  (off by default) tints noteheads + choices by pitch class (Boomwhacker,
  `note_colors.dart`) in Reading Quiz + Place the Note, with a legend.
- **Play-in-time lane** — **Beat Runner**: note-value markers fall spaced by
  their REAL durations over a steady click; tap each as it crosses the
  hit-line. Ticker master clock, space/tap, Perfect/Good by accuracy.

## Gamified formats — shipped

- **Note Match** (memory / concentration pairs) — flip a grid to pair a
  note-on-staff with its letter; each flip plays the pitch; fewer moves → more
  stars. SRI on each match.
- **Note Order** (sequence / ordering) — tap four shuffled note cards from
  lowest pitch to highest; each correct tap plays + locks with a badge. SRI
  `note_reading.order.len4`.
- **Sort the Beats** (sort into buckets) — drag note-value symbols into their
  1 / 2 / 4-beat bucket; wrong drop bounces + buzzes. SRI `note_values.symbol.*`.
- **Line or Space?** (swipe binary drill) — swipe a note-card left = line,
  right = space; wrong swipe bounces back. SRI `note_reading.line_space.*`.
- **Falling Notes** (arcade) — notes rain down real partitura staves; name the
  glowing one on a 7-letter pad before it crosses the neon hit-line. Combo
  ×1–×5, speed ramps every four catches, three hearts, fixed 15-note run,
  star-driven range, colour-scaffold, reduced-motion aware. Feeds
  `note_reading.treble.*`. The **"play it" variant** ships too: **Falling Keys**
  drops the same notes onto a piano keyboard (SRI `keyboard.find.*`).
- **Connect the Notes** (connect-a-line matching) — notes on staves left, names
  shuffled right; drag a wire from each note to its name (`CustomPaint`).
  Correct link locks + plays; clears to advance. SRI `note_reading.treble.*`.
  The **symbol↔meaning** column ships as **Connect the Symbols** (Notenwerte,
  `note_values.symbol.*`) — same engine, a `mode` flag.

## Partitura-powered — shipped

Games built on partitura capabilities the app didn't use before.

- **Name That Chord** (chords) — read or hear a chord and pick its symbol; the
  answer is graded by partitura's `identifyChord`, so it names quality **and**
  inversion. Roots C–A (no accidental in the symbol); major/minor root position
  for beginners, diminished/augmented and slash-chord inversions (C/E) at 2★.
  Renders the chord as a block on the staff, replay button, keyboard 1–4. SRI
  `chords.name.<root>_<type>`.
- **Chord Builder** (chords) — build the named chord by tapping three notes onto
  the staff; partitura's `identifyChord` grades what you built, so **any voicing
  counts** — root position or an inversion, in any octave. The interactive
  counterpart to Name That Chord; major/minor for beginners, dim/aug at 2★. SRI
  `chords.build.<root>_<quality>`.
- **ABC import** (Song Book) — the importer takes pasted **ABC notation**
  (`scoreFromAbc`) alongside MusicXML / ChordPro / MIDI, stored as MusicXML like
  the rest. Opens the large public-domain ABC folk-tune libraries; the tune's
  `T:` line seeds the title.
- **Concert Pitch** (new **Transposing** module/corner) — read a written note
  for a **B♭ trumpet / E♭ alto sax / F horn** and name the concert pitch that
  actually sounds; partitura's `transposeBy` computes the exact letter. The B♭
  instruments alone for beginners, E♭ and F added at 2★. A skill nothing else in
  the app covers. SRI `transpose.<instrument>.<written-step>`.
- **Bowing** (cello corner) — read partitura's string-bowing marks: a note on
  the bass staff carries a ⊓ down-bow or ∨ up-bow (`Articulation.downBow/upBow`);
  name it. SRI `cello.bowing.<down|up>`.
- **Which Beat?** (measures) — a 4/4 bar with one note coloured; tap the beat it
  starts on (1–4). partitura's **`showBeatNumbers`** overlay draws the count
  under the staff as a scaffold that fades (on at level 1, off at 2★). SRI
  `measures.beat.<n>`.
- **Time Signatures** (measures) — read a signature — including the **C
  (common)** and **¢ (cut)** glyphs — and give the beats per bar. 3/4·4/4·C for
  beginners; ¢·6/8·2/4 at 2★. SRI `measures.timesig.<id>`.
- **ABC export** (Composition Workshop) — an AppBar action renders the current
  score to **ABC** (`scoreToAbc`) in a dialog and copies it to the clipboard;
  round-trips with the Song Book's ABC import.
- **Duet** (note reading) — read the **highlighted part of a two-staff system**
  (partitura's `StaffSystemView`): two parts are shown, one note highlighted;
  name it, tracking the right line. Both treble for beginners; the lower part
  becomes bass clef at 2★, like a grand-staff duet. SRI
  `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
- **Drum Read** (new **Drums** corner) — read a two-bar rhythm on the neutral
  **percussion clef** and tap it back on the drum pad. After a one-bar count-in
  the notation goes live; each tap is judged Perfect/Good/Miss against the
  notated onsets over a steady click (one Ticker master clock, no drift). A
  no-fail performance toy.

## Toy-inspired mechanics — shipped

- **Strum Toy** (guitar corner) — a free, no-scoring jam: pick an open chord
  (C/G/D/Em/Am) and swipe across the strings to strum (down = low→high, up =
  high→low) or tap one to pluck. Voiced as an arpeggio-into-block-chord (the
  synth is monophonic), colour-coded strings, keyboard 1–5 + space/arrows.
- **Sound Echo** (memory-sequence toy) — four pentatonic pads; the app lights +
  plays a growing sequence, the child echoes it; one miss ends the run. Made
  educative: noteheads on a mini-staff (C-major pentatonic) and **cues fade as
  the sequence grows** — colour + sound + notation first, then colour drops,
  then sound, until the longest runs are read from noteheads alone.
- **Follow the Conductor** (command caller, reworked into a metre lesson) — the
  baton traces the real conducting figure for the time signature (2/4, 3/4,
  4/4); the target zone lights on each beat (accented downbeat) and the child
  follows — taps or arrow keys. Scored by timing; kinaesthetic downbeat.

## Original concepts — shipped

- **Recital Mode** (progression meta) — a home-bar "recital" strings a 3–5 piece
  programme (favouring games the child has already practised) into one set; play
  each in turn and the run ends on a **curtain call** that tallies the stars
  earned across the whole programme. Wraps the review loop in a set-piece.
- **Note Snake** (note reading) — reading meets the classic arcade snake: a
  target note shows on the staff, letters sit on a grid, and you steer the snake
  (arrow keys or an on-screen pad) to eat the letter that names it. Eating the
  wrong letter — or biting your tail — ends the run; it wraps at the edges and
  speeds up as you grow. Star-gated range, colour-scaffold, treble + bass. Feeds
  `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
- **Chord Grip Hero** (keyboard) — Falling Keys for chords: a triad falls on the
  staff and its keys glow on the piano; press all of them before it lands. Full
  grips speed up the next; three ungripped landings end the run. White-key
  diatonic triads of C major (playable without black keys); C/F/G major for
  beginners, the Dm/Em/Am minors at 2★. Feeds `keyboard.chord.*`.
- **Staff Runner** (note reading) — an endless sight-reading sprint: one note at
  the read-line with a depleting timer bar; name it before the bar empties.
  Every correct read shortens the next timer (the "speed up"); three misses
  (wrong name or timeout) end the run, score = notes read. Star-gated range,
  colour-scaffold, letter-key control, treble + bass. A stepping-stone to the
  generative-sight-reading big swing. Feeds `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
- **Interval Ladder** (chords & intervals) — interval *construction*: a base
  note is shown with a chip saying how far and which way to climb (▲3 = a third
  up); tap the candidate note at that interval (a correct pick plays base→target
  melodically). Thirds/fifths up for beginners, all sizes and both directions at
  2★. SRI `chords.interval.build.<n><up|down>`.
- **Dynamics & Tempo Charades** (expression) — expressive vocabulary the app
  didn't touch: a phrase plays at one of four tempi (Adagio→Presto) or four
  dynamic levels (pp→ff); name what you heard. The two clear extremes for
  beginners, all four terms at 2★. Needed a `gain` on the synth so dynamics are
  actually softer/louder (the output is otherwise peak-normalized). SRI
  `expression.hear.<tempo|dynamics>.<term>`.
- **Odd One Out** (note reading) — whack-a-mole under gentle reaction pressure:
  noteheads pop up in a 3×2 grid of holes, a target letter is called ("Whack:
  A") and the child taps the matching notes before they duck. Correct whacks
  grow a ×1–×5 combo; a wrong whack costs a heart (3 lives); a fixed 12-whack
  run keeps the score/1–3★ loop, with the hole lifespan shrinking as it goes.
  Ticker-driven, star-gated octave range, colour-scaffold aware, letter-key
  control, reacting mascot; treble + bass. Feeds `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
  *(Extends to a "wrong-note" spot-the-error mode.)*
- **Odd One Out** (note reading) — three note cards; two share the same letter
  name at different octaves, one is a different letter. Tap the odd one out — a
  discrimination drill that trains rapid name-reading, not just notehead
  matching. Star-gated octave range (staff → ledger), colour-scaffold aware,
  number-key control, reacting mascot; treble + bass variants. Feeds the shared
  `note_reading.<clef>.*` pool on the odd note. *(Extends to chord-quality and
  scale-degree "odd one out" by ear.)*
- **Ledger Leap** (note reading) — a note sits exactly on the Nth ledger line
  (never a space, so the count is unambiguous); tap 1 / 2 / 3. Star-gated
  (treble/middle-C region first; +bass, above, 3 lines at 2★). A correct count
  plays the pitch. SRI `note_reading.ledger.<clef>.<below|above><n>`.
- **Key Detective** (scales) — partitura renders a key signature
  (`KeySignature(fifths)`); name the major key. Natural-letter tonics
  (C G D A E B F) so buttons never need an accidental; German B = H via the
  naming toggle. Star-gated (C/F/G/D → +A/E/B); correct answer plays the tonic
  triad. SRI `key_sig.<tonic>`.
