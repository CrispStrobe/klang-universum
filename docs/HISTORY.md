# KlangUniversum — Shipped history

The record of what's been built and lives in production
([mus-theta.vercel.app](https://mus-theta.vercel.app)). Forward-looking work —
what's pending and planned — lives in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md); this file is the
changelog it graduated from.

## Progression

- **Stars persist** (`ProgressService`): best stars/score and play count per
  game, shown on every game tile.
- **Star-driven difficulty**: 2+ stars widen a game's material (reading
  games gain the ledger range incl. middle C; Scale Detective gains D and A
  major; Measure Filler gains sixteenths). More expansions per game over
  time — SM-2 mastery stays the long-term signal, stars the session signal.
- **Soft unlock gating**: a module unlocks once the *previous* one has
  ≥ `kModuleUnlockTracked` SRI-tracked items (the child genuinely played
  there). Engagement gate, not a mastery gate — mastery gating proved too
  slow for a 6-year-old's first week. Locked cards explain what to play
  first.

## Audio (v1)

`core/audio/synth.dart` synthesizes everything in pure Dart — no assets, no
licensing: piano-ish additive tones (pitches, chords, arpeggios, sequences)
rendered to WAV and played via `audioplayers` (data-URI source on web), plus
CrispFXR-style retro square-wave SFX (correct blip, wrong buzz, fanfare —
same procedural approach as the maintainer's
[CrispFXR](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispFXR-web) /
[crispaudio](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crispaudio) projects, in Dart).
`AudioService` wires it app-wide; feedback sounds run centrally through
`QuizRoundMixin`. First ear game shipped: Major-or-Minor.

**Selectable instrument voices:** the synth carries four timbres — piano, a
reedy sustained **cello**, a soft **flute**, and a bright fast-decaying **music
box** — each a distinct harmonic profile + attack/decay. Settings has an
instrument picker (icon chips, previews on tap); the choice persists and drives
all pitched playback app-wide (retro SFX unchanged).

## Textbook (read-through curriculum)

A read-through learning path over the grade-1–10 concept map (`core/curriculum/concept_map.dart`): the **Textbook** screen (📖 in the home bar) lists each grade band's concepts; a concept expands to its **lesson** (the same zero-knowledge primer the games auto-show — see it, hear it) and **practise** links straight into the games that train it. Concepts with no game yet show "coming soon", so the path stays honest against the coverage gap analysis. Built on the same concept inventory + primers as the gap-analysis tooling.

**Fully localised + narrative (de/en).** `features/textbook/textbook_i18n.dart` (ARB-backed) localises all 70 concept titles, the 19 concept-area sub-headers and the 5 grade-band short labels, and supplies a **narrative intro paragraph per grade band**. Each band's concepts are grouped **by area** (sub-headers in first-appearance order, so the map's teaching sequence is preserved), so the reader reads like a book rather than a flat list.

**Read-aloud narration (TTS).** A 🗣 read-aloud button in the shared tutorial sheet speaks the current lesson/how-to step, so a pre-reader (6–8yo) can *hear* it before they can read it — the same sheet backs both the textbook's "Read the lesson" and every game's "?" primer, so both narrate from one change. `core/services/tts_service.dart` wraps `flutter_tts` (on-device platform voices, offline, de+en) behind a `TtsBackend` seam; locale-aware, gated by the master sound switch, best-effort (a missing OS voice just stays quiet).

**Neural voice (CrispASR / Kokoro).** Behind the same seam, `core/audio/tts/` adds a higher-quality on-device backend: the `crispasr` pub FFI package → `libcrispasr` (ggml) running **Kokoro** (82 M params, Apache-2.0, de+en). Model files come from CrispASR's **own registry + downloader** — `registryLookup('kokoro')` resolves the already-published `cstr/kokoro-82m-GGUF` model and `cacheEnsureFile` fetches it into `~/.cache/crispasr` (the same `-m auto` path the CLI and CrisperWeaver use); no hand-rolled URLs, nothing to publish. Resolve + download + synthesis all run in a background isolate (→ 24 kHz PCM → WAV → AudioService); a conditional-import facade keeps dart:io/ffi out of the web build (web → null stub). Downloading is consent-gated (playback never fetches; an opt-in `download()` mirrors CrisperWeaver's model manager), and `TtsService` prefers the neural voice when the lib + model are present, else the platform voice. Registry resolution + the real macOS synth are test-verified. A **"Natural voice (HD)" tile** in Settings (below the sound switch) is the opt-in: it appears only where the native lib loads, downloads the ~135 MB model on tap (spinner → "On ✓"), and once cached narration auto-upgrades to the neural voice. Per-platform `libcrispasr` bundling is the remaining step.

## Composition Workshop

A section *outside* the minigames (home-bar piano button) — a full touch- and
desktop-first score editor built on an editable `ScoreDocument` (a flat element
stream packed into bar-lined measures, with multi-level undo/redo). The grown-up
sibling of the My Melody sandbox. What it does now:

- **Entry** — pick a note value (whole…sixteenth, dotted) + accidental; write by
  tapping the staff, tapping the on-screen **sweepable piano** (C1…, octave
  labels), or the **computer keyboard** (A–G pitches, 1–5 values, R rest, arrows,
  `.` dot, `S` slur, Del, ⌘/Ctrl Z·Y·C·X·V). A blank-staff click *places* a new
  note (like a piano key); an existing note is re-pitched by dragging it up/down.
- **Chords** — a ⧉ toggle stacks pitches at one timeslot; the model is multi-pitch.
- **Selection & editing** — tap to select, **marquee** (⛶ rubber-band) to select
  a range; move/copy/cut/paste, transpose (↑/↓), set duration/accidental, delete.
  **Fine drag-reorder**: a horizontal note drag moves it to the exact drop slot
  (across bars and wrapped lines); a vertical drag re-pitches.
- **Notation** — dynamics · articulations · ties (anchored palette) · **slurs** ·
  **crescendo/diminuendo hairpins** · **multi-verse lyrics** (inline field +
  verse selector) · **pickup / anacrusis** (top-bar dropdown) · a visible
  insertion **caret** · single staff or **grand staff** (auto-split by pitch).
- **Chrome** — clef/time/key/zoom/pickup fold into one top row; an (i) sheet
  lists the keyboard shortcuts; leaving with unsaved work asks keep/discard/save;
  the engraving width is bound to the viewport so systems break on-screen.
- **I/O** — a single **Open…** picker reads any supported score by extension —
  MusicXML (+ compressed `.mxl`), MIDI, ABC, MEI, Humdrum `**kern`, MuseScore
  (`.mscx`/`.mscz`), Guitar Pro (`.gp`/`.gpx`) — and a single **Export…** sheet
  writes MusicXML/`.mxl` · MIDI · ABC · MEI · `**kern` · MuseScore · LilyPond ·
  Braille · **SVG** (font embedded) · **PNG**, saving via the system dialog (text
  formats fall back to a copyable view where a platform has no save picker). All
  parsers/writers are pure-Dart (web-safe). Also save to the Song Book. The macOS
  file pickers work now (added the `files.user-selected.read-write` sandbox
  entitlement — the app is sandboxed, so without it the dialogs were blocked).

Notation-depth + Studio-shell + playback arc (2026-07, the parity push):

- **Notation depth** — **tempo marks** (initial `Score.tempo` + mid-score
  `Measure.tempoChange`), **grace notes** (a per-note pitch list, acciaccatura/
  appoggiatura), **ornaments** (trill/mordent/turn), **tuplets**, **mid-score
  clef/key/time changes**, **mid-*bar* clef changes** (`inlineClefs`), **repeats +
  voltas + navigation** (D.C./D.S./coda/segno/fine), and `RhythmPolicy.split` (tie
  over-long notes across barlines). All built on one id-anchor/field pattern on the
  flat document, all lossless through the MusicXML save→reopen.
- **Two voices** — an optional **voice 2** per part (`Measure.voice2`) with a
  V1/V2 toolbar toggle; the flat doc keeps `_v1`/`_v2` and the active voice drives
  entry, so the mutation sites are untouched.
- **Studio shell** — a **Sandbox/Studio shelf** toggle reveals grown-up depth
  (an **Insert/Select** input-mode toggle and a selection-driven **inspector**
  panel) together, while the kid Sandbox surface stays simple.
- **Playback** — a real **transport** with a moving cursor that highlights the
  sounding notes; **multi-part** playback mixes every part into one WAV with a
  **per-part mute**; a **practice-speed** control (0.5×/0.75×/1×) slows playback
  without changing pitch. Reflects repeats/navigation/split via the timeline.
  Two opt-in practice tools (⋮, default off): a **count-in** — a bar of clicks
  rendered into the same WAV so it can't drift from the music, counted in the
  meter's own beat unit — and **loop selection**, which repeats the selected range
  until Stop, clipping every part so the accompaniment loops with the melody.

Editing extras that lean on crisp_notation's editor contracts: caret (C2), drag-move
(C3), grand staff (C5), element hit-regions for marquee + fine reorder
(**C7** `ElementRegionController`), and one-call `Score→PNG/SVG` export
(**C8**). Detail + roadmap: `docs/WORKSHOP_PLAN.md`.

## Live microphone & pitch detection

The app's first **real-instrument input** (the structural gap every strong rival
had and we didn't). Pure-Dart chain: mic → PCM → pitch/chroma analysis, no
plugins beyond capture.

- **Play-along / Sing-along** — a **moving score**: target notes scroll
  right-to-left past a fixed "now" line while your live pitch is drawn as a dot,
  so you see yourself land on (or drift from) each note. Scoring is a pure
  `PlayAlongEngine` (right pitch — optionally octave-agnostic for voices —
  within a cents window for enough of the note); the screen just drives the
  Ticker clock, feeds it mic readings, and paints. No audible backing on purpose
  (the mic would hear the speaker; a Preview button plays it first).
- **Sing along / Play along with any Song Book song** — the song viewer has both
  buttons; each derives a target melody from the song's notation (`chartFromScore`
  — top pitch per note, timed from the playback timeline) and drops it into the
  same moving-score highway. **Sing along** is octave-agnostic (match it in your
  own range); **Play along** targets the written octave, for an instrument. Stars
  scale to the song's length (`scaledStarScore`), so a long song isn't a free 3★.
  Turns the Song Book (and the groove→Song Book export) into practice material.
- **Tuner** (cello corner) — open the mic, detect the note, show cents sharp/
  flat on an intonation meter. The whole chain mic → PCM → detector → meter.
- **Chord Listener** — fuzzy chord recognition from the live mic: strum/play a
  chord and it names the closest match with runner-up guesses and the 12-bin
  pitch-class profile it heard (chroma analysis — "name the chord" beats
  "transcribe every note").
- **Perform It** (note reading) — mic-graded *reading*: a note is shown and the
  child **plays or sings it** — the pitch detector verifies it (octave-agnostic,
  held briefly to avoid false hits) instead of a letter tap. Live detected-note
  readout, star-gated range, skip button, mic-permission handling; feeds the
  shared `note_reading.<clef>.*` SM-2 pool. The kid-scale core of performance-
  graded sight-reading.
- **Sing Back** (scales/ear) — ear→voice: a note *plays* (not shown), the child
  **sings it back**, and the mic checks the pitch (octave-agnostic, held
  briefly). A "hear it again" button, the answer reveals on a correct sing, skip
  + mic-permission handling. Trains pitch memory and matching with no instrument;
  feeds the ear pool `scales.hear.sing_<step>`.
- **Sing the Interval** (Chords) — ear→voice on the *interval*: two notes play,
  low then high, its name is shown ("a fifth"), and the child **sings the top
  note back** (mic checks the pitch class, octave-agnostic). The sung twin of
  Interval Ear — builds interval vocabulary *and* the voice to reproduce it.
  Reuses the Sing Back capture harness + crisp_notation's `Interval` /
  `Pitch.transposeBy`; third/fourth/fifth for beginners, second + sixth at 2★.
  SRI `intervals.sing.<name>`.
- **Cello Play It** (Cello Corner) — mic grading on the *real instrument*: a
  first-position note is shown on the bass staff with a string + finger hint;
  the child bows it on their cello and the mic verifies the pitch
  (octave-agnostic — kind to the low C string — held a touch longer to shrug off
  the bow's scratchy attack). "Hear it" + skip buttons, mic-permission handling.
  Turns the finger/string knowledge active; feeds the cello play pool
  `cello.play.<step><octave>`.

## Curriculum (Lehrplan alignment)

A **Curriculum** screen (home-bar 🏫) that maps the games onto a syllabus.
Deliberately **un-branded, generic progress levels tied to school years**
(Klasse 1–2 … 9–10) — the topic scope distilled in our own words from public
school curricula, no badge/association branding. A small data engine
(`Curriculum → Level → Topic → gameIds`) with topic labels reused across levels;
per-region variants are drop-in data (`region` field).

- **Readiness** per level/topic = **star coverage × SM-2 retention**: breadth
  (played + performed the games) modulated by whether skills actually stuck
  (`SriService.masteryUnder(namespace)` — mean per-item mastery, neutral until a
  namespace is practised so there's no discouraging cold start).
- Study guidance: a **"continue here"** marker on the recommended level, and
  **"practise your weakest topic"** — both running curated recitals of the
  relevant games. A test guards every mapped game ID against the registry.
- Internal licensing rationale (why no D-branding) lives in the gitignored
  `CLAUDE.md`, not here.

## Playtest cycle — polish, reworks & tools

A full parent/child playtest pass. Grouped by kind.

**Correctness & UX fixes:** Symbol Quiz renders note/rest **on a staff** (rests
now identifiable) · Rhythm Echo **sounds from the first tap**, rings while held ·
Sort the Beats — much **larger bucket glyphs** + the bottom **mascot reacts** ·
Connect columns pulled **close together** · Line or Space is **tappable** (+
arrow keys), not swipe-only · Falling Notes **starts ~half speed** · Triad
Builder is a **single measure** (taps land where the note appears) · My Melody
uses an **adaptive clef** (a cello's low C shows in bass) · Song Book karaoke
highlight **no longer drifts** behind the audio · Cello "Which String?" is scoped
to the **open strings** (unambiguous).

**Pedagogy reworks** (games that "made no sense"): **Follow the Conductor** →
real **conducting patterns** (metre/downbeat) · **Beat Runner** → a **rhythm-
reading lane** (note-value markers spaced by their true durations) · **Scale
Detective / Builder** → harder, into **minor keys** (harmonic minor defeats the
spot-the-accidental shortcut) · **Sound Echo** → noteheads on the pads with
**cues that fade** (colour → sound → read alone).

**Deeper features:** Melody Echo **lights notes L→R** as a card plays · Melody
Dictation **edit-in-place** (tap a note to re-pitch/delete) · **bass-clef
variants** of Line or Space, Note Order, Falling Notes and Connect (violin +
bass, own SRI + stars) · **keyboard control** app-wide (number keys select any
answer grid; arrow keys drive Line or Space & the Conductor; space/enter the
rhythm lane; C–B letter keys catch Falling Notes) · **Progress "tricky spots"**
now shows every skill (coloured module icons, skill-typed labels), not just
notes · **Tenor Clef reading** is gated as an advanced unlock — the tile shows
locked until the child has 2★ in both other Cello-Corner games (a general
per-game `unlockedWhen` gate on `GameInfo`).

## Opportunity backlog — shipped

- **Note-naming toggle:** German H/B, English, solfège — one setting, every
  drill. Reinforces EN/DE.
- **Daily streak + practice calendar** (flame + count + 7-day dots on home;
  finishing a game marks the day).
- **"Wait mode" pacing** — advance only on the correct answer, no timed fail
  (`QuizRoundMixin` retries until correct, no timers/lives anywhere); guarded
  by a contract test.
- **Reacting mascot** — a pure-Dart quarter-note character in the shared
  feedback line: hops + grins on correct, damped wobble + "oops" on wrong;
  reduced-motion aware.
- **Opt-in timer + beat-your-time** — off by default; when on, the result
  screen shows completion time + personal best + "new best!" (no live clock).
- **Bilingual EN/DE pedagogy** foregrounded — the note-naming toggle advances
  it in-app; the rest is positioning.
- **Weak-spot ear engine + "your tricky notes"** — `SriService.weakestItems`
  + a card on the Progress screen with readable labels; SM-2 re-drills them.
- **Functional cadence → scale-degree ear mode** — "Hear the Function"
  (harmony): a I–IV–V–I cadence establishes the key by ear, then a target
  chord is named T/S/D. SRI `harmony.hear.*`, review-routed.
- **Landmark / intervallic reading hints (fading)** — the Reading Quiz shows a
  landmark chip ("a skip up from E") anchoring on memorized lines + middle C;
  fades with mastery (gone at 3★ and in review). `reading_hint.dart`.
- **Written melodic dictation** — **Melody Dictation**: a melody plays (audio
  only), the child writes it by tapping noteheads onto the InteractiveStaff,
  per-note feedback + undo + note-for-note check. SRI
  `note_reading.dictation.len3`. (Rhythm dictation served by Rhythm Echo.)
- **Removable colour scaffold** — Settings toggle "Colour helper for beginners"
  (off by default) tints noteheads + choices by pitch class (Boomwhacker,
  `note_colors.dart`) in Reading Quiz + Place the Note, with a legend.
- **Play-in-time lane** — **Beat Runner**: note-value markers fall spaced by
  their REAL durations over a steady click; tap each as it crosses the
  hit-line. Ticker master clock, space/tap, Perfect/Good by accuracy.

## Gamified formats — shipped

- **Longest First** (Notenwerte) — the ordering/sequence format on note *values*:
  four shuffled note-value symbols; tap them longest → shortest, each playing its
  own duration and locking with a number badge, a wrong tap buzzes. The
  note-values sibling of Note Order (which orders pitches). SRI
  `note_values.order.len<N>`.
- **Note Match** (memory / concentration pairs) — flip a grid to pair a
  note-on-staff with its letter; each flip plays the pitch; fewer moves → more
  stars. SRI on each match.
- **Note Order** (sequence / ordering) — tap four shuffled note cards from
  lowest pitch to highest; each correct tap plays + locks with a badge. SRI
  `note_reading.order.len4`.
- **Sort the Beats** (sort into buckets) — drag note-value symbols into their
  1 / 2 / 4-beat bucket; wrong drop bounces + buzzes. SRI `note_values.symbol.*`.
- **Line or Space?** (swipe binary drill) — swipe a note-card left = line,
  right = space; wrong swipe bounces back. SRI `note_reading.line_space.*`.
- **Falling Notes** (arcade) — notes rain down real crisp_notation staves; name the
  glowing one on a 7-letter pad before it crosses the neon hit-line. Combo
  ×1–×5, speed ramps every four catches, three hearts, fixed 15-note run,
  star-driven range, colour-scaffold, reduced-motion aware. Feeds
  `note_reading.treble.*`. The **"play it" variant** ships too: **Falling Keys**
  drops the same notes onto a piano keyboard (SRI `keyboard.find.*`).
- **Connect the Notes** (connect-a-line matching) — notes on staves left, names
  shuffled right; drag a wire from each note to its name (`CustomPaint`).
  Correct link locks + plays; clears to advance. SRI `note_reading.treble.*`.
  The **symbol↔meaning** column ships as **Connect the Symbols** (Notenwerte,
  `note_values.symbol.*`) — same engine, a `mode` flag. A third mode,
  **Connect the Steps**, links an interval on a staff (two half-notes) to its
  *number* — count the note-names, C→G spans 5; 6th/7th join at 2★. SRI
  `intervals.size.*`.
- **In the Scale?** (swipe/tap binary) — a note on a card; swipe/tap/arrow-key
  IN if it belongs to C major (a natural), OUT if it's sharpened (chromatic).
  Wrong bounces back. SRI `scales.member.<in|out>`.
- **High or Low?** (sort into two baskets) — treble notes above vs below the
  middle line drag into HIGH / LOW baskets; correct drop sounds the note. The
  Sort-the-Beats bucket format on pitch *direction*. SRI `pitch.height.*`.
- **Sharp or Flat?** (sort into two baskets) — each note carries a sharp or a
  flat; drag it into the matching basket. Reading the accidental sign is the
  skill. SRI `accidentals.sign.*`.
- **Dotted or Not?** (sort into two baskets) — drag note glyphs into Dotted /
  Plain baskets by reading the **augmentation dot** (which makes a note half
  again as long). The note value varies (half/quarter/eighth) so the shape alone
  doesn't give it away. Reuses the Sharp-or-Flat? sort scaffold. SRI
  `note_values.dot.<dotted|plain>`.
- **Higher or Lower?** (ear, binary) — two notes play in sequence; tap whether
  the second is higher or lower. No staff — the aural twin of High or Low?. Big
  replay button. SRI `pitch.hear.<up|down>`.
- **Same or Different?** (ear, binary) — the youngest pitch-discrimination skill
  (Kodály): two notes play; tap whether they are the same pitch or different. A
  clear leap for beginners, subtler gaps (down to a semitone) at 2★. Replay
  button, no staff. SRI `pitch.hear.<same|diff>`.
- **Ascending or Descending?** (ear, binary) — a short run of notes plays; tap
  whether it climbs up or steps down. A step past Higher or Lower? — a whole
  phrase moves one way, not just two notes. Three notes for beginners, four at
  2★. Replay button, no staff. SRI `pitch.hear.<asc|desc>`.
- **Step or Skip?** (staff reading, binary) — two notes on the staff; read
  whether the move is a step (the next line/space, a 2nd) or a skip (a bigger
  leap). The motion vocabulary that precedes naming exact intervals. Correct
  answer sounds both notes. SRI `reading.motion.<step|skip>`.

## CrispNotation-powered — shipped

Games built on crisp_notation capabilities the app didn't use before.

- **Tie or Slur?** (Noten lesen) — reads the two curved marks that look alike but
  mean different things: a **tie** joins the *same* pitch (`NoteElement.tieToNext`),
  a **slur** joins *different* pitches (`Score.slurs`). A binary staff-read like
  Step or Skip?; the card engraves the two-note figure, two buttons, audio on
  correct. SRI `reading.curve.<tie|slur>`.
- **Beam or Flag?** (Noten lesen) — the two looks of eighth notes: joined by a
  **beam** (two eighths on one beat) vs each keeping its **flag** (eighths split
  by an eighth rest). The engraver has no beam-suppression API, so the cards
  exploit the real rule; the beam/flag contrast was verified at the crisp_notation
  layout level (same-beat eighths → 1 `BeamPrimitive`, eighth-rest between → 0).
  SRI `reading.beam.<beamed|flagged>`.
- **On the Beat or Off?** (Takte) — reading + hearing **syncopation**. A straight
  bar (four quarters on the beats) vs a syncopated one (eighth + 3 quarters +
  eighth, so the inner notes land off the beat); playback uses the real note
  lengths so the push is audible. Fills the curriculum's syncopation gap. SRI
  `measures.syncopation.<straight|syncopated>`.
- **Even or Triplet?** (Notenwerte) — reading how a beat is split: two even eighths
  vs a **triplet** (a real `TupletSpan(0,2,actual:3,normal:2)` → the engraver draws
  the bracket + 3), heard as 2-in-a-beat vs 3-in-a-beat. Fills the triplet/tuplet
  gap. SRI `note_values.tuplet.<even|triplet>`.
- **Which Family?** (Lieder) — a reading/knowledge quiz that closes the instrument-families gap: an instrument is named (~19 well-known ones), the child taps its orchestral family — Strings / Woodwind / Brass / Percussion / Keyboard. Deliberately *not* timbre-ID (the synth has too few timbres to hear the difference); `instrumentFamilyPrimer` names the families with familiar examples. SRI `timbre.family.<family>`; 10 rounds, [100,600,900].
- **Label the Form** (Komponieren) — hearing and *seeing* a piece's shape, an AnaVis-in-miniature. Each section is a short motif; a reusable `FormTimeline` widget draws the sections as colour-coded blocks (same colour = same tune), and the child picks the form — ABA / AAB / ABC for beginners, AABA / ABAB / rondo (ABACA) at 2★ (where the block labels hide, so the repeat pattern must be read from the colours). Fills the musical-form + verse/chorus gaps. SRI `composition.form.<FORM>`.
- **Which Mode?** (Skalen) — a three-way modal ear game beyond major/minor: a scale plays ascending from a tonic as **Major** (Ionian), natural **Minor** (Aeolian), or **Dorian**, and the child picks which. Dorian is the trap — minor-shaped but with a *raised 6th*, so it sounds "minor with a brighter twist"; the scales are built from exact semitone step patterns so that one distinguishing note is really there. `modePrimer` teaches the three colours (shown + heard). Fills the modes gap. SRI `scales.mode.<major|minor|dorian>`.
- **Which Ornament?** (Noten lesen) — read the sign over a note: **trill** (tr),
  **mordent** (squiggle), or **turn** (sideways S), drawn via `NoteElement.ornament`
  and each played as a little flourish (trill = fast alternation, turn = the curl
  around). Fills the ornaments gap. SRI `note_reading.ornament.<trill|mordent|turn>`.
- **Spot the Upbeat** (Takte) — a binary staff-read on where a tune begins: a
  short two-bar melody starts either on the downbeat (a full first measure) or
  with a **pickup / anacrusis** (an incomplete first measure — a few notes before
  the first barline). The pickup is a real `Measure(..., pickup: true)`, so the
  first bar genuinely holds less than the meter (a proper anacrusis, borrowed from
  the last bar). At 2★ the note-counting shortcut is defeated — full bars may use
  mixed rhythms (half + two quarters: three noteheads but still a full 4/4), and
  the pickup runs 1–2 notes — so the answer needs real metric reading. Correct →
  the melody plays. SRI `measures.upbeat.<yes|no>`.
- **Enharmonic Twins** (Noten lesen) — a binary staff-read on enharmonic
  equivalence, a Sek-I staple nothing else drills: two whole notes (each with its
  accidental) across two bars — **same sound spelled two ways** (F♯ = G♭) or two
  **genuinely different** pitches? Graded by `midiNumber` equality, so it is exact
  and the child must read past the spelling. Five sharp/flat twins for beginners;
  the trickier white-key twins (E♯ = F, F♭ = E) join at 2★; "different" rounds are
  guaranteed non-enharmonic and non-trivial (adjacent steps, at least one
  accidental). Correct → both notes play. SRI `reading.enharmonic.<yes|no>`.
- **Connect the Notes — four new modes** (Notenwerte) — the connect-a-line board
  grew from 3 to 7 modes, each one `ConnectMode` case reusing an existing catalog
  so nothing drifts: **Dynamics** (mark glyph ↔ meaning, `connect_dynamics`,
  shares `reading.dynamics.*` with Louder or Softer?), **Rests** (rest glyph ↔ the
  note it equals in length, `connect_rests`, `note_values.rest.*`), **Tempo Words**
  (Italian term ↔ meaning, `connect_tempo`, shares `reading.tempo.*` with Faster
  or Slower?), **Beats** (note value ↔ how many beats in 4/4, `connect_beats`,
  `note_values.beats.*`).
- **Sharp / Natural / Flat — 3-basket sort** (Noten lesen) — *Sharp or Flat?*
  (`accidental_sort`, +bass) widens at 2★ to a three-basket sort adding the
  **natural** sign, rendered as a real ♮ via `NoteElement.showAccidental` on an
  unaltered pitch; below 2★ it stays the binary ♯/♭ drill. Card sign refactored
  bool→`int alter`. SRI gains `accidentals.sign.natural`.
- **Key Change?** (Scales) — a modulation ear game: a short phrase either stays
  in one key or modulates partway through (its second half lifted a perfect 4th
  or 5th to a new tonic); the child taps "Same key" vs "Key changed". Phrases are
  built from a C-major fragment ending on the tonic; the changed variant shifts
  the second fragment up 5/7 semitones. Closes the `modulation` concept-map gap.
  SRI `scales.modulation.<same|changed>`; `modulationPrimer` teaches it by ear.
- **Triad or Seventh?** (Chords) — an ear game on the added seventh: a major
  triad (3 notes) vs a dominant-7 (triad + a minor 7th, 4 notes), tap which. The
  dom7 is built app-side from the major `Triad`'s pitches +
  `root.transposeBy(Interval.minorSeventh)` — no 7th-chord *builder* needed from
  crisp_notation. Completes the chord-quality-by-ear widening. SRI
  `chords.hear.<triad|seventh>`.
- **Read the Voice** (Noten lesen, gated behind Duet 2★) — reading one line out
  of a multi-voice texture, on crisp_notation's `Measure.voice2` (two voices per
  staff, stems up/down). A chord is shown with one voice highlighted; the child
  names the note *that* voice sings, so they must track the right line. The
  4-voice generalization of Duet: difficulty grows 2 voices (Soprano + Alto, one
  treble staff) → full **SATB** (four voices across a grand staff via
  `StaffSystem`). Voiced with a no-crossing `nextChordTone`-above algorithm (bass
  in octave 3, alto pushed to middle C so S/A land on treble, T/B on bass).
  C major; a "hear this voice" button; SRI feeds the shared reading pool. First
  of three scoped SATB minigames.
- **Which Voice?** (Noten lesen, gated behind Duet 2★) — the inverse of Read the
  Voice: a note in the chord is highlighted and the child picks which voice it is
  (Soprano/Alto/Tenor/Bass). Trains voice-position and range awareness (where
  each voice lives on the grand staff) rather than pitch naming. Same 2-voice →
  SATB progression, shared `satb_voicing.dart`. SRI `note_reading.voice.<voice>`.
  Second of three scoped SATB minigames.
- **Hear the Voice** (Noten lesen, gated behind Duet 2★) — the aural SATB game:
  the full chord plays, then one voice alone, and the child identifies which
  voice they heard (S/A/T/B). No notation — pure ear-training; at 2 voices it's
  "higher or lower?", at full SATB the inner voices make it a real listening
  challenge. Shared voicing, cancellable audio timers, a replay button. SRI
  `note_reading.ear_voice.<voice>`. Completes the three scoped SATB minigames
  (Read / Which / Hear the Voice).
- **"Handwritten notes" theme** (Settings) — a toggle that renders all notation
  in **Petaluma**, Steinberg's jazz/handwritten SMuFL face (SIL OFL 1.1),
  instead of Bravura. The font (+ metadata + OFL) is vendored in
  `assets/smufl/`; its licence shows on the About page. Every StaffView /
  MultiSystemView site now routes through `shared/score_theme.dart`'s
  `kidsScoreTheme`, which applies the selected `MusicFont` (Bravura by default);
  the toggle updates a global so screens entered afterwards pick it up. A
  cosmetic delight, and the plumbing for further faces (Leland/Leipzig) later.
- **Chord Chart** (Chords) — lead-sheet literacy: a chord *symbol* is shown
  (G, Dm, D7…) and the child taps the matching *notation* among four little
  staves. The inverse of Name That Chord (notation→symbol); symbols come from
  `chordSymbolFor` so they're spelled as the library names them. Correct tap
  plays the chord; widens major/minor triads (roots C/F/G) → all roots → +
  diminished. SRI `chords.symbol.<symbol>`. Uses the shared game-test harness.
- **Strong Beat?** (Takte) — metric-accent training on crisp_notation-public's
  `beatStrength`. A measure is shown with its beat numbers (crisp_notation's
  `showBeatNumbers`), one beat highlighted; the child says whether it's a strong
  (accented) or weak beat. The answer is graded by
  `TimeSignature.beatStrength(position)`, not hard-coded — correct for 4/4 (1 & 3
  strong), 3/4 (only 1) and 6/8 (1 & 4). A metric click accents the strong beats.
  Widens 4/4 → +3/4, 2/4 → +6/8. SRI `measures.accent.<ts>_<beat>`.
- **Roman Numerals** (Harmonik) — read *and* hear a diatonic triad in a key and
  pick its Roman numeral (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii°). The chord is built with
  `Triad(root, quality)` and named by crisp_notation-public's new
  `romanNumeralOf(pitches, key)` — the same analyser will later carry sevenths
  (`V6/5`), inversions and minor keys. A step up from the Function Quiz (T/S/D
  only): every diatonic degree is in play. Renders the chord with the key
  signature, arpeggio-then-chord audio + replay, four numeral buttons. Widens
  I/IV/V in C major → all seven degrees → all easy major keys. SRI
  `harmony.roman.<symbol>`. *(First game on the crisp_notation-public alignment — mus
  now builds against `CrispStrobe/crisp_notation@main` locally and on CI.)*
- **Name That Chord** (chords) — read or hear a chord and pick its symbol; the
  answer is graded by crisp_notation's `identifyChord`, so it names quality **and**
  inversion. Roots C–A (no accidental in the symbol); major/minor root position
  for beginners, diminished/augmented and slash-chord inversions (C/E) at 2★.
  Renders the chord as a block on the staff, replay button, keyboard 1–4. SRI
  `chords.name.<root>_<type>`.
- **Chord Builder** (chords) — build the named chord by tapping three notes onto
  the staff; crisp_notation's `identifyChord` grades what you built, so **any voicing
  counts** — root position or an inversion, in any octave. The interactive
  counterpart to Name That Chord; major/minor for beginners, dim/aug at 2★. SRI
  `chords.build.<root>_<quality>`.
- **Major or Minor?** (chords) — a drag-and-drop sort on triad **quality** read
  off the staff: each card shows a triad; drag it into the Major or Minor basket
  (the third is what decides it). The reading twin of the aural Dur-oder-Moll? and
  the sort-into-buckets sibling of Sharp or Flat?, on the `accidental_sort`
  scaffold; built with crisp_notation `Triad(root, ChordQuality)`, the chord
  sounds on a correct drop. At 2★ a third basket — Diminished — joins (the lowered
  fifth), mirroring how Sharp or Flat? grows a Natural basket. SRI
  `chords.quality.<major|minor|diminished>`.
- **ABC import** (Song Book) — the importer takes pasted **ABC notation**
  (`scoreFromAbc`) alongside MusicXML / ChordPro / MIDI, stored as MusicXML like
  the rest. Opens the large public-domain ABC folk-tune libraries; the tune's
  `T:` line seeds the title.
- **Concert Pitch** (new **Transposing** module/corner) — read a written note
  for a **B♭ trumpet / E♭ alto sax / F horn** and name the concert pitch that
  actually sounds; crisp_notation's `transposeBy` computes the exact letter. The B♭
  instruments alone for beginners, E♭ and F added at 2★. A skill nothing else in
  the app covers. SRI `transpose.<instrument>.<written-step>`.
- **Write It for the Instrument** (Transposing) — the **inverse** of Concert
  Pitch: a **concert pitch** (what sounds) is shown on the staff; name the note a
  B♭/E♭/F instrument must **read** to produce it (`transposeBy` in the opposite
  direction). B♭ alone for beginners, +E♭/F at 2★; a correct answer plays the
  concert pitch. Together the two games drill both directions of transposition.
  SRI `transpose.<instrument>.write_<concert-step>` — a distinct leaf, so the two
  games never overwrite each other's SM-2 items.
- **Bowing** (cello corner) — read crisp_notation's string-bowing marks: a note on
  the bass staff carries a ⊓ down-bow or ∨ up-bow (`Articulation.downBow/upBow`);
  name it. SRI `cello.bowing.<down|up>`.
- **Which Beat?** (measures) — a 4/4 bar with one note coloured; tap the beat it
  starts on (1–4). crisp_notation's **`showBeatNumbers`** overlay draws the count
  under the staff as a scaffold that fades (on at level 1, off at 2★). SRI
  `measures.beat.<n>`.
- **Time Signatures** (measures) — read a signature — including the **C
  (common)** and **¢ (cut)** glyphs — and give the beats per bar. 3/4·4/4·C for
  beginners; ¢·6/8·2/4 at 2★. SRI `measures.timesig.<id>`.
- **ABC export** (Composition Workshop) — an AppBar action renders the current
  score to **ABC** (`scoreToAbc`) in a dialog and copies it to the clipboard;
  round-trips with the Song Book's ABC import.
- **Duet** (note reading) — read the **highlighted part of a two-staff system**
  (crisp_notation's `StaffSystemView`): two parts are shown, one note highlighted;
  name it, tracking the right line. Both treble for beginners; the lower part
  becomes bass clef at 2★, like a grand-staff duet. SRI
  `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
- **Drum Read** (new **Drums** corner) — read a two-bar rhythm on the neutral
  **percussion clef** and tap it back on the drum pad. After a one-bar count-in
  the notation goes live; each tap is judged Perfect/Good/Miss against the
  notated onsets over a steady click (one Ticker master clock, no drift). A
  no-fail performance toy.
- **Which Clef?** (Noten lesen) — the youngest clef-literacy drill: a bare clef
  is drawn on an empty staff (`StaffView` over `Measure([])`) and the child taps
  which clef it is. Treble vs Bass for beginners, widening to **Alto and Tenor**
  at 2★ (all four rendered by crisp_notation's `Clef`). A binary `AnswerGrid`, no-fail;
  nothing else in the app taught reading the clef *sign* itself. SRI
  `reading.clef.<treble|bass|alto|tenor>`.
- **Whole or Half Step?** (Noten lesen) — the tone-vs-semitone drill and the
  foundation of scale-building: two neighbour notes (a 2nd) are shown; tap
  whether the gap is a whole step or a half step, then hear it played. Because
  half steps hide only at E–F and B–C, a plain 2nd isn't enough — the child must
  read the letters. Balanced generation (`Clef.pitchAt`), naturals only; treble
  for beginners, +bass clef at 2★. The natural sequel to Step or Skip?. SRI
  `reading.tone.<whole|half>`.

## Toy-inspired mechanics — shipped

- **Strum Toy** (guitar corner) — a free, no-scoring jam: pick an open chord
  (C/G/D/Em/Am) and swipe across the strings to strum (down = low→high, up =
  high→low) or tap one to pluck. Voiced as an arpeggio-into-block-chord (the
  synth is monophonic), colour-coded strings, keyboard 1–5 + space/arrows.
- **Sound Echo** (memory-sequence toy) — four pentatonic pads; the app lights +
  plays a growing sequence, the child echoes it; one miss ends the run. Made
  educative: noteheads on a mini-staff (C-major pentatonic) and **cues fade as
  the sequence grows** — colour + sound + notation first, then colour drops,
  then sound, until the longest runs are read from noteheads alone.
- **Follow the Conductor** (command caller, reworked into a metre lesson) — the
  baton traces the real conducting figure for the time signature (2/4, 3/4,
  4/4); the target zone lights on each beat (accented downbeat) and the child
  follows — taps or arrow keys. Scored by timing; kinaesthetic downbeat.

## Original concepts — shipped

- **Tracker** (composition) — a touch-first **pattern sequencer** in the spirit
  of ModEdit / FastTracker 2 / Scream Tracker 3 / Impulse Tracker, but
  **dual-audience** (a 10-year-old builds a groove; an adult finds it cool) via
  two skins over one document — the same Sandbox/Studio idea as the Workshop.
  Pick an instrument tab, tap a **scale-locked pentatonic piano-roll** (pitch
  rows × step columns), and every channel layers into one looping groove. It's
  the Loop Mixer with an **editable grid**: `tracker_engine.dart` renders each
  channel to a stem and sums them through `synth.dart mixStems` → one looping
  WAV on `LoopPlayerService`, with the same Stopwatch-phase swap (edits re-enter
  the loop in phase) and Ticker playhead. Instruments hang off a
  `TrackerInstrument` seam: **additive** timbres, **sfxr chiptune** (a focused
  pure-Dart port of the maintainer's
  [crispaudio](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crispaudio) SynthEngine into
  `core/audio/crisp_dsp/sfxr.dart` — blips/zaps/booms synthesized per-note at
  pitch), and **recorded voice**: the flagship *record-your-voice → play a tune
  with it* bridge — `voice_clip_recorder.dart` captures a mic clip, a voice
  effect (chipmunk/monster/deep via a ported **formant shifter**, robot via
  ring-mod + bit-crush — all pitch-stable so the sample stays in tune) is
  applied, and it becomes a resampled tracker instrument on a runtime-swappable
  `voice` channel. All DSP ported (MIT) from the maintainer's crispaudio /
  CrispFXR / voicelab. A **bidirectional notation bridge** links it to reading:
  Tracker → Score renders the selected channel as a live `StaffView` "score view"
  (held runs → tied notes, bar-split); Score → Tracker imports a melody back onto
  the grid (partial — quantize + top-note + pentatonic snap), round-trip tested.
  **Studio depth:** a per-channel instrument picker (additive + chiptune), a
  **drums** channel (drum-row grid), **song mode** (4 pattern slots A–D + an
  editable order-list + a song-length playhead), and **per-note dynamics**
  (long-press → soft "ghost" notes). Sandbox, no stars. (Mic capture is
  device-only; the DSP + assign→play path are unit-tested headlessly.)
- **Module formats & cross-format converters** (Tracker, `core/audio/mod/`) — the
  Tracker speaks the classic tracker file formats, all in **pure Dart** (web-safe,
  no native deps). **Readers** for ProTracker `.mod`, Scream Tracker 3 `.s3m`,
  FastTracker 2 `.xm` and Impulse Tracker `.it` — the hardest part, IT's IT214/215
  variable-bit-width sample **decompression**, was pinned by an oracle round-tripped
  **44/44 against libxmp's `itsex.c`** before a line of Dart was written.
  **Writers** for all four. A format-neutral **`ModuleDoc` hub** (pitch as MIDI so
  notes keep their pitch across formats, PCM normalized to ±1) turns the readers and
  writers into a **complete N×N converter matrix — any of {mod,s3m,xm,it} → any of
  {mod,xm,s3m,it}** (`parseAnyModule` sniffs by signature; conversion carries notes/
  instruments/volume/samples/structure, dropping per-cell effects in v1). Every
  codec was built the same disciplined way — a hand-authored, self-verified golden
  fixture (committed, license-clean) + a skip-if-absent live test over a real
  module, with one sub-agent implementing one file against a written contract. Also
  exposed as **headless CLIs** (`bin/modinfo.dart` dumps any module; `bin/modconv.dart`
  converts between formats and extracts samples to WAV — "steal an instrument" from
  the shell), Flutter-free like `bin/listen.dart`. In the app: MOD + MIDI
  import/export via a `file_selector` menu (the MIDI↔MOD hub reuses crisp_notation's
  Score bridge — no external converter).
- **Loop Mixer — beatbox + jam along** (composition, ladder slice 10) — the
  mic closes the circle twice more. **Beatbox a beat:** count-in, 2 bars of
  "boom-ts-pss" into the mic, and it comes back as a teal drum card — onset
  detection + kick/snare/hat classification (`beat_capture.dart`) on new
  rms/zero-crossing-rate features every `PitchReading` now carries, with
  thresholds calibrated against the app's own synth drums through the real
  detector and an acceptance test that a synthesized beatbox reconstructs
  the exact pattern. **Jam along:** the groove keeps playing while the mic
  listens (platform echo-cancel + a headphones hint); every note you play or
  sing lights up green (tone of the sounding chord — progression-aware),
  amber (pentatonic) or red — the loop mixer as a backing band that tells
  you when you fit.
- **Loop Mixer 2.0 — the groovebox ladder** (composition) — the v1 toy grew
  into an instrument in seven shipped slices (engine v2 → sing-a-track), all
  behind the same five-cards kid surface. **Feel:** a swing slider (off-eighth
  delay on an exact boundary grid), per-card A/B/C pattern variants (incl. a
  euclidean/Bjorklund drum groove), per-card levels, and an automatic drum
  fill every 4th loop, swapped in at the loop seam where the downbeat kick
  masks it. **Harmony:** a progression lane (I–V–vi–IV · I–IV–V–I · vi–IV–I–V)
  turns the 2-bar vamp into a 4-bar song — bass and chords re-voice per chord
  from chord-tone shapes (`ChordFollower`), melody/sparkle stay pentatonic
  (axis progressions absorb it) — verified end-to-end by rendering the bass
  and reading it back with `bin/listen.dart` (every bar's root/root/fifth/root
  detected exactly). **Notation:** a score panel engraves the leading track
  live via crisp_notation (`groove_notation.dart` — cells → 4/4 bars, greedy
  durations). **Keep it:** the whole groove is one small `GrooveSpec` value —
  a serverless `KU1.…` share token (copy/paste anywhere, defensively parsed)
  plus desktop WAV export. **Generativity:** infinite mode re-renders a
  seeded variation at every seam (hats breathe, snare ghosts, pentatonic
  melody ornaments; the kick never moves). **The mic:** *sing a track into
  existence* — count-in, 2-bar capture, the MPM pitch trace quantized to the
  step grid, octave-normalized and pentatonic-snapped (`groove_capture.dart`),
  and the child's own melody becomes a sixth card: toggleable, mixable,
  engraved as sheet music, carried inside the share token. Deep pattern
  *editing* is deliberately left to the Tracker (one grid editor in the app);
  beatbox→drums + AEC jam mode remain on the roadmap as slice 10.
- **Loop Mixer** (composition) — a kid **loop-layering toy**: five cards
  (drums · bass · chords · melody · sparkle) each toggle a pre-authored 2-bar
  loop; everything is C-pentatonic so any combination grooves (the Colour
  Melody rule). A sandbox — no stars, no wrong answers. Under the hood the
  first **multi-track** audio in the app, still pure Dart + one player:
  `loop_engine.dart` mixes the enabled tracks offline into a single looping
  WAV (sample-accurate sync for free), with **combo-independent levels**
  (unit-peak per stem + authored gains + a tanh soft-knee in
  `synth.dart mixStems` — toggling a card never changes the others' loudness)
  and **seeded noise percussion** (kick sweep / snare / hat one-shots — the
  additive synth is tonal, so drums got their own generator). The screen owns
  a Stopwatch musical clock and swaps mixes with `play(position: phase)`, so
  layers drop in/out **without the bar restarting**; a dedicated
  `LoopPlayerService` (ReleaseMode.loop) keeps SFX and groove from stopping
  each other. Step-dot playhead (Ticker), 75/100/120 BPM presets, per-combo
  render cache. Acceptance-tested end-to-end by rendering stems and reading
  them back with `bin/listen.dart` (bassline detected exactly as authored;
  pad reads C 98% → Am 98%).
- **Colour Melody** (composition) — a composing grid for **pre-readers**: five
  coloured rows (a C-major pentatonic, so every combination is consonant) × eight
  beats. Tapping a cell places a note (and sounds it), and the grid renders live
  to a **real crisp_notation `Score`** shown underneath — so a non-reader is
  quietly writing notation. Play the tune back (rests preserved via
  `playChordSequence`, empty beats = silence) or clear. A sandbox like My Melody —
  no stars, no wrong answers; the bridge to notation for those who can't read yet.
- **Melody doodle** (composition) — Colour Melody's **gesture** twin: drag a
  freehand line across the box and it *becomes* a tune. The contour is quantised
  to one C-pentatonic note per beat (a column averages its points, so a scribble
  reads as its overall height; the top of the box is the highest note; untouched
  beats stay rests) and renders live to a **real `Score`** underneath. Beat guides
  and a coloured dot per quantised beat show the line turning into notes as you
  draw, and a note sounds only when the drag crosses into a new beat. A sandbox —
  no stars. For the youngest: "draw music" before you can tap a grid.
- **Find the Key (bass)** (keyboard) — the staff→piano bridge in bass clef: the
  reusable `PianoKeyboard` shifts two octaves down (C2..B3) so the low staff
  naturals (G2..A3) and the 3★ black-key targets land on real keys. Own
  `progressId`; the SRI token carries the octave so bass items never collide with
  the treble Find the Key. Completed the bass-clef sweep of the reading/keyboard
  games.
- **Recital Mode** (progression meta) — a home-bar "recital" strings a 3–5 piece
  programme (favouring games the child has already practised) into one set; play
  each in turn and the run ends on a **curtain call** that tallies the stars
  earned across the whole programme. Wraps the review loop in a set-piece.
- **Note Snake** (note reading) — reading meets the classic arcade snake: a
  target note shows on the staff, letters sit on a grid, and you steer the snake
  (arrow keys or an on-screen pad) to eat the letter that names it. Eating the
  wrong letter — or biting your tail — ends the run; it wraps at the edges and
  speeds up as you grow. Star-gated range, colour-scaffold, treble + bass. Feeds
  `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
- **Chord Grip Hero** (keyboard) — Falling Keys for chords: a triad falls on the
  staff and its keys glow on the piano; press all of them before it lands. Full
  grips speed up the next; three ungripped landings end the run. White-key
  diatonic triads of C major (playable without black keys); C/F/G major for
  beginners, the Dm/Em/Am minors at 2★. Feeds `keyboard.chord.*`.
- **Staff Runner** (note reading) — an endless sight-reading sprint: one note at
  the read-line with a depleting timer bar; name it before the bar empties.
  Every correct read shortens the next timer (the "speed up"); three misses
  (wrong name or timeout) end the run, score = notes read. Star-gated range,
  colour-scaffold, letter-key control, treble + bass. A stepping-stone to the
  generative-sight-reading big swing. Feeds `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
- **Interval Ladder** (chords & intervals) — interval *construction*: a base
  note is shown with a chip saying how far and which way to climb (▲3 = a third
  up); tap the candidate note at that interval (a correct pick plays base→target
  melodically). Thirds/fifths up for beginners, all sizes and both directions at
  2★. SRI `chords.interval.build.<n><up|down>`.
- **Dynamics & Tempo Charades** (expression) — expressive vocabulary the app
  didn't touch: a phrase plays at one of four tempi (Adagio→Presto) or four
  dynamic levels (pp→ff); name what you heard. The two clear extremes for
  beginners, all four terms at 2★. Needed a `gain` on the synth so dynamics are
  actually softer/louder (the output is otherwise peak-normalized). SRI
  `expression.hear.<tempo|dynamics>.<term>`.
- **Odd One Out** (note reading) — whack-a-mole under gentle reaction pressure:
  noteheads pop up in a 3×2 grid of holes, a target letter is called ("Whack:
  A") and the child taps the matching notes before they duck. Correct whacks
  grow a ×1–×5 combo; a wrong whack costs a heart (3 lives); a fixed 12-whack
  run keeps the score/1–3★ loop, with the hole lifespan shrinking as it goes.
  Ticker-driven, star-gated octave range, colour-scaffold aware, letter-key
  control, reacting mascot; treble + bass. Feeds `note_reading.<clef>.*`.
  *(Extends to a "wrong-note" spot-the-error mode.)*
- **Odd One Out** (note reading) — three note cards; two share the same letter
  name at different octaves, one is a different letter. Tap the odd one out — a
  discrimination drill that trains rapid name-reading, not just notehead
  matching. Star-gated octave range (staff → ledger), colour-scaffold aware,
  number-key control, reacting mascot; treble + bass variants. Feeds the shared
  `note_reading.<clef>.*` pool on the odd note. *(Extends to chord-quality and
  scale-degree "odd one out" by ear.)*
- **Ledger Leap** (note reading) — a note sits exactly on the Nth ledger line
  (never a space, so the count is unambiguous); tap 1 / 2 / 3. Star-gated
  (treble/middle-C region first; +bass, above, 3 lines at 2★). A correct count
  plays the pitch. SRI `note_reading.ledger.<clef>.<below|above><n>`.
- **Key Detective** (scales) — crisp_notation renders a key signature
  (`KeySignature(fifths)`); name the major key. Natural-letter tonics
  (C G D A E B F) so buttons never need an accidental; German B = H via the
  naming toggle. Star-gated (C/F/G/D → +A/E/B); correct answer plays the tonic
  triad. SRI `key_sig.<tonic>`.

## Agent coordination board — shipped log (chronological)

These are the `✅ idle / SHIPPED` entries that accumulated on the top-of-
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) coordination board as parallel agents finished work. Moved
here verbatim (2026-07-17) to keep PLAN.md focused on pending work. Newest-ish
first, as they sat on the board.

- **opus (articulation)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — "Read the Mark" articulation minigame**
  (`cedf4da`, Noten lesen). Fills a real gap: ties/slurs + note values were
  covered, but the note-attached articulation marks had no reading game. A
  binary staff-read on the `step_skip` scaffold — one note carries an
  articulation glyph (staccato dot / accent wedge, drawn by crisp_notation
  `layout_marks`); the child matches it to its name. Binary at 1★ (Staccato vs
  Accent), full four-way (+Tenuto/Marcato) from 2★; a correct answer sounds the
  note (short for staccato). `GameInfo` in note_reading + `kStarThresholds`
  bracket + EN/DE ARBs. SRI `reading.articulation.<name>`. 4 tests (incl. an
  assertion that the rendered `StaffView` actually carries the glyph). Whole-
  project analyze clean.

- **opus (aec-res-c)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — residual echo suppression ported to the
  native C engine** (`b3bf617`). Completes the native AEC algorithm stack (DTD +
  RES, both now in the C engine, all headlessly verified). `src/aec_dsp.{c,h}`
  gained an `AecRes` (a port of the Dart `ResidualEchoSuppressor`, reusing the
  DSP's own `aec_fft`/`ifft` and the same overlap-save Wiener framing with a
  DTD-gated leakage estimate); FFI-bound as `AecRes` in `lib/aec_dsp.dart` with
  an offline cross-check (RES deepens echo-only ERLE >3 dB past the linear
  filter). Wired **opt-in** into the engine block loop (`aec_engine_set_res` /
  `AecEngineFfi.setRes`), its leakage gated on the DTD's single-talk decision;
  needs a distinct output buffer (can't run in place). Headless engine test +
  whole native suite 10/10 via `build.sh`. Remaining native AEC is on-device
  only (milestone e): app opt-in via `setDtd`/`setRes` + real-hardware tuning.

- **opus (aec-engine-dtd)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — DTD wired into the native engine
  block loop** (`c11ddc7`). The DTD was ported to the C DSP core (`f7487fd`) but
  nothing used it; now `aec_shim.c`'s `engine_run` (the shared core the realtime
  duplex callback AND the headless pump both run) drives it per block — read
  `aec_dtd_freeze` → `aec_dsp_set_adapt` → process → `aec_dtd_update`. Opt-in via
  a new `aec_engine_set_dtd()` (default off — a DTD hurts without a clean
  convergence window, so this keeps the existing continuous-double-talk engine
  test green); FFI-bound as `AecEngineFfi.setDtd(bool)`. Headless double-talk
  test in `test/aec_engine_test.dart` (converge→double-talk through the pump,
  DTD-on near-end error <0.7× DTD-off). Whole native suite 8/8 via `build.sh`.
  All in `native/aec/` (out of app CI). Remaining native AEC: port RES to C; app
  opt-in via `setDtd` (milestone e, needs on-device tuning).

- **opus (aec-res)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — residual echo suppression**
  (`15a6d62`). **The patent-free AEC algorithm roadmap is COMPLETE (DTD + RES).**
  `ResidualEchoSuppressor` (`aec_offline.dart`): a Wiener-style spectral
  post-filter on what the linear filter leaves, reusing the canceller's own
  overlap-save framing (2·blockSize `[prev;cur]` frame, spectrally gained, keep
  the last block — no window/COLA bookkeeping). Per bin the residual echo is
  `λ(k)·|Ŷ(k)|²` with the echo leakage **λ learned only on far-end single-talk
  (DTD-gated)** — during double-talk the near-end inflates the residual and would
  drive λ, and the suppression, far too high; a `gainFloor` bounds attenuation.
  Opt in: `cancelEcho(residualSuppress:)` / `StreamingEchoCanceller` /
  `bin/aec.dart --res` (compose with `--dtd`). **Measured: echo-only segmental
  ERLE 39.3 → 54.6 dB (+15.3), double-talk SI-SDR unchanged (15.8 vs 15.9, −0.1)
  — deeper echo suppression without chewing the voice.** 25 tests (5 new). No
  app / Workshop / native plugin touched.

- **opus (aec-dtd)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — double-talk detector** (`a10d6bd`,
  patent-free AEC roadmap item 1). The linear core kept adapting on near-end
  speech; a DTD freezes it while the near-end is present. **`DoubleTalkDetector`**
  (`aec_offline.dart`) uses a normalized-correlation statistic
  `corr(mic, echoEst=W·x)` — ≈1 on far-end single-talk, drops on double-talk —
  needing no echo-path-gain threshold (unlike Geigel); warmup guard + hangover.
  Additive **`EchoCanceller.process(..., {bool adapt = true})`** gates the NLMS
  update (default true ⇒ C port + existing callers untouched; `EchoCanceller` is
  CLI/test-only, jam uses the native engine). Wired into
  `cancelEcho(doubleTalkDetect:)`, `StreamingEchoCanceller`, `bin/aec.dart --dtd`.
  **Result: double-talk SI-SDR 8.8 → 15.9 dB (+7.1 dB vs linear)**, echo-only
  cancellation unchanged. 20 tests (4 new). No app / Workshop / native plugin
  touched.

- **opus (aec-metrics)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — AEC quality metrics + thorough
  tests** (`1e0bc8c`). Patent-free metrics in `lib/core/audio/aec_offline.dart`:
  **segmental ERLE**, **convergence time**, **SI-SDR** (scale-invariant SDR,
  Le Roux 2019 — the gain-invariant double-talk fidelity metric), + an
  `AecMetrics.measure/report` bundle. Explicitly NOT PESQ/POLQA (license/patent
  encumbered); AECMOS is MIT but native-ORT-only (our pure-Dart
  `onnx_runtime_dart` lacks conv/GRU ops). `bin/aec.dart --selftest` reports the
  full set on the standard converge→double-talk scenario. **16 tests** (broadband
  convergence + exact delay, small block size, no-NaN, far-end-silence exact
  passthrough, SI-SDR identity/scale-invariance/monotonicity, streaming≡batch
  w/ refDelay, flush padding, empty-input). Docs: patent-free rationale in
  `AEC_TIER3B.md`. No app/Workshop/native-plugin touched.

- **AEC — what's left (unclaimed; verification now UNBLOCKED).** The patent-free
  *algorithm* roadmap is done (DTD `a10d6bd` + RES `15a6d62`), but **both live only
  in the Dart/CLI path** (`aec_offline.dart`); the app's jam mode runs the native C
  engine, which still has neither.
  ✅ **opus (next): fixed the native verify harness** (`native/aec/build.sh`
  `dart test` → `flutter test` — the tests import `package:flutter_test`, so
  `dart test` errored "Could not find package test"; the C build was fine). **The
  6-test ERLE cross-check now runs green on this Mac**, so the port below is finally
  verifiable. Two open items, in value order:
  1. **Port DTD (+ later RES) to `native/aec`** (`src/aec_dsp.c` + the shim's block
     loop) so the app's jam mode gets the +7 dB double-talk protection. Suggested:
     do **DTD first** (simpler, higher value), RES second. Add a `dtdEnabled` +
     hangover/block-counter to `AecDsp`, compute `rho = dot(mic, echoEst)/√(mm·ee)`
     (echoEst = the predicted echo `yRe[b+i]`), and gate the NLMS update
     (`aec_dsp.c` ~L209–231) when frozen. ⚠️ **Fidelity trap:** match
     `DoubleTalkDetector` (aec_offline.dart) EXACTLY — its `update()` runs the
     block-counter + hangover **decrement every block**, incl. far-end-silent
     ones, whereas `aec_dsp_process` **returns early** on the far-end VAD (L190–196);
     do the DTD state bookkeeping BEFORE that early return or the freeze timing
     drifts from the Dart reference. Keep DTD **off by default** so the existing
     default-`adapt` cross-check still matches; add a NEW test asserting
     native-with-DTD ≈ Dart-with-DTD on a double-talk scenario. Verify with
     `bash native/aec/build.sh`. Keep CI-safety (analyzer exclusion, app green
     without the plugin).
  2. **(e) on-device tuning** — the real duplex path on iOS/Android hardware
     (mic permission, AVAudioSession category, latency/ring). Needed before jam
     AEC is real at all; see `docs/AEC_TIER3B.md`.

  Verify either with the `bin/aec.dart` harness (`--selftest`, `--dtd --res`) and
  the BlackHole rig. Same patent-free family as SpeexDSP MDF / WebRTC AEC3 (read
  for technique, don't vendor unless licence + tree stay clean).

- **opus (aec-cli)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — AEC streaming CLI** (`dafacb1` D1,
  `afbe4ea` D2). Test echo cancellation over files/pipes headlessly — the
  pure-Dart `EchoCanceller` the native Tier-3b core is a cleanroom port of, so
  no device/FFI needed. **D1:** Flutter-free `lib/core/audio/aec_offline.dart`
  (`estimateEchoDelay`, `cancelEcho(mic,ref)→cleaned+ERLE+delay`,
  `StreamingEchoCanceller` for interleaved stereo PCM16 → cleaned mono, running
  ERLE, buffers partial frames), 4 tests (tail ERLE >20 dB, near-end preserved
  under double-talk, delay recovery, streaming≡batch byte-equality). **D2:**
  pipe-first `bin/aec.dart` — `--selftest` (band+instrument+echo → PASS: ~48 dB
  echo-only ERLE, instrument survives), `--mic/--ref/--out` files, `--stdin`
  interleaved-stereo mic|ref → cleaned mono stdout (or `--detect` notes);
  deduped `bin/listen.dart`'s `--aec` onto the shared core. Verified over a real
  OS pipe (stereo gen → `aec --stdin` → `listen --stdin` reads the instrument,
  echo gone). Docs: streaming section in `AEC_TIER3B.md`. The offline analogue
  of the BlackHole rig, runnable in CI. **No app screens / ARBs / Workshop /
  native plugin touched.**

- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — keyboard-first nav in Select mode**
  (`b26a6b5`, last small Cause-2 item). Select-mode A–G keys jump the selection to
  the next note on that pitch (wrapping, accidental-insensitive) via
  `ScoreDocument.selectNextOfStep(Step)` — Insert enters notes, Select navigates
  them. **With this the WORKSHOP_PARITY arc + all its polish are shipped**; the
  only open items are "if ever wanted" (categorized insertion palettes; multi-
  select/rest inspector depth; grace-note LIST beyond one run — a library ask).
  ✅ **PDF export SHIPPED** (`e0954bd`, bucket G's last open
  item). **No library change** — `SystemLayout.layout` *is* a `ScoreLayout` and
  `renderLayoutToPng` takes one, so `layoutPages(score, settings, metrics:)`
  line-breaks + paginates, each `PositionedSystem` rasters to a PNG (through the
  app's painter → correct Bravura glyphs, 3× for print), and the `pdf` package
  places each at its exact staff-space position on an A4 box (staff-spaces →
  points via one spatium). Raster-per-system because the SVG path embeds
  `@font-face` text the pdf pkg can't parse + Bravura is CFF/OTF (TTF-only
  embedder). `+pdf ^3.11.0`, `lib/features/workshop/export/score_pdf.dart`,
  "PDF (print)" in `kExportFormats`, `test/score_pdf_test.dart` (valid header +
  real pagination + size scaling, under `runAsync`). Now: Select-mode letter keys
  jump the caret instead of no-op'ing.
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — value strip un-dual-purposed**
  (Cause 2's other grievance). The strip stays deliberately dual-purpose on
  **Sandbox** (arm the next note *and* fix the selected one — forgiving, what kids
  expect; unchanged, no regression). **Studio** honours the input mode instead:
  *insert* arms without silently rewriting the selection, *select* applies the
  pick to the selection. One `_pickAppliesToSelection` getter gates
  `_pickValue`/`_toggleDot`/`_pickAccidental`; arming always happens so the armed
  glyph stays in step. Widget tests pin all three behaviours (via barCount: a
  selected quarter → whole spills a bar). **Cause 2 is now fully addressed.**
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — inspector multi-select** (polish).
  The Studio inspector now edits a **multi-note selection**, not just a single
  note (the ⌃ palette's old Cause-3 limitation): articulation/tie chips reflect
  "all selected have it" and toggle the whole selection; dynamic/ornament
  dropdowns show the shared value (or blank when mixed) and set all; the
  single-anchor grace / change-here buttons disable for a multi-selection. Rests
  now read out instead of showing the empty hint. Widget test drives a 2-note
  selection into the inspector. `screens/composition_workshop_screen.dart` only.
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — Sandbox/Studio shelf toggle**
  (`5d467dc`, the two-shelves capstone). One `_Shelf { sandbox, studio }` switch
  (⋮ menu, default Sandbox): Sandbox hides the Studio-tier controls (V1/V2 voice
  toggle, Insert/Select mode toggle, inspector) → simple kid surface; Studio
  reveals them all together. Leaving Studio resets input mode→insert,
  inspector→off, active voice→0. **This closes the Studio-shell arc** — voice 2,
  the inspector (Cause 3), input modes (Cause 2) and now the shelf that unifies
  them. EN/DE; widget tests (Sandbox hides / Studio reveals; the depth-control
  tests enter Studio first). **The WORKSHOP_PARITY.md arc is now substantially
  complete** (A–G + the two shelves); remaining is polish — richer inspector
  (multi-select/rests/bar attrs), insertion palettes, keyboard-first nav in
  select mode, page/print view, PDF. Next agent: see `WORKSHOP_NEXT_HANDOVER.md`.
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — Studio shell Causes 2+3.** **Cause 2
  (input modes)** `8526bc0`: an `_InputMode { insert, select }` on the screen,
  default insert (= today). Select mode makes empty-staff taps deselect (not
  place) and letter keys no-op (`_onStaffTap`/`_onMpStaffTap`/`_handleKey` gate on
  it); tapping a note still selects, the piano still places. Insert⇄Select toggle
  (icon+label) in the top bar. EN/DE; widget test. **Remaining Studio work:** a
  real **Sandbox/Studio shelf toggle** (one switch that reveals the Studio-tier
  surfaces — inspector, mode toggle, future insertion palettes — instead of each
  being gated separately), richer inspector (multi-select / rests / bar
  attributes), and categorized insertion palettes. **The Workshop parity arc's big
  buckets (D notation-depth, F playback, Studio shell) are now all substantially
  shipped.** — Cause 3 (inspector) SHIPPED below:
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — Studio shell Cause 3 (inspector)**
  (`6306151`). A selection-driven properties panel (`WORKSHOP_PARITY.md` Cause 3):
  an **opt-in** side panel (⋮ menu toggle, OFF by default → Sandbox unchanged) that
  reflects/edits the selected note — articulations/tie (FilterChips), dynamic +
  ornament dropdowns, buttons to the grace + change-here dialogs; reuses the `_doc`
  mutators. Canvas `Expanded` became `Row[canvas, panel]`. The ⌃ palette stays.
  EN/DE; widget test (off-by-default → toggles on → shows controls). **Remaining
  Studio work — Cause 2 (input modes):** an explicit insert-vs-select state machine
  (today staff-taps always place; `_onElementTap` already selects, so the piece is a
  "select mode" that stops empty-staff placement + a status-line mode + keyboard-
  first entry). Also open: richer inspector (multi-select, rests, bar attributes),
  a real Sandbox/Studio shelf toggle. ✅ **voice 2 SHIPPED** (`bb6b7d0`):
  `Measure.voice2`, a sibling `_v2` stream sharing the bar grid via the `_elements`
  active-voice getter (mutation sites untouched); `_withVoice2` reflow+stamp
  (byte-identity fast path); V1/V2 toolbar toggle; MusicXML round-trips. ✅ **mid-bar
  clef SHIPPED, fully lossless** (`12404e1`/`854ab25` + crisp_notation writer
  `3c1b8bd`).
- **opus (next)** · ✅ **idle.** Worktree `../mus-next`, branch
  `feature/workshop-next`. All shipped & recorded in [HISTORY.md]: Workshop tempo
  marks · grace notes · playback bucket F · multi-part playback · voice-2 playback ·
  practice speed · count-in + loop-a-selection; Song Book **Sing along + Play along**
  (`chartFromScore`) with length-scaled stars; **Melody doodle** game; and the
  **native-AEC verify-harness fix** (`eba8c4d`, `build.sh` → `flutter test`) that
  unblocks the AEC C port (top item in the scoped block above). My feature lane is
  exhausted — remaining work is in the scoped "🎯 Remaining work" block at the top.

- **opus (groove-export)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Groove → Song Book / MusicXML**
  (`docs/LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md` §A; `3c816ab` A1, `a7c3554` A2+A3).
  The Loop Mixer's share sheet now saves the groove as a **real multi-part
  score** — the payoff of the toy and the on-ramp to the Workshop. **A1:** pure
  `grooveParts()` in `groove_notation.dart` — enabled pitched tracks
  (voice·melody·chords·sparkle·bass) → one `Score` each (bass clef for bass) →
  `MultiPartScore`; drums/beat skipped (no percussion staff yet). **A2:** share
  sheet "Save to Song Book" → `multiPartToMusicXml` → `UserSongsService.addSong`
  (gated on a pitched track). **A3:** "Export sheet music (MusicXML)" desktop
  save. l10n de/en (`loopMixerSaveSongBook/ExportMusicXml/SaveTitle`). Tests:
  8/8 groove_notation + 12/12 loop_mixer (multi-part round-trip through the
  Song Book). **No Workshop files touched.** Only §B (native-AEC jam grading)
  of the handover remains unclaimed.

- **opus (jam-grading)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Groove jam: native-AEC grading
  ("the band listens back")** (`docs/LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md` §B;
  `915a17a` B1, `5e99e84` B2+B3). This closes the Loop Mixer follow-ups handover
  — **both §A and §B done.** **B1:** pure-Dart `lib/core/audio/loop_reference.dart`
  (`LoopReferenceScheduler`: loop PCM → real-time reference windows, seam wrap +
  phase-preserving swap-at-downbeat, `barAt`), 6 tests. **B2:** jam mode picks the
  Tier-3b `AecEngine` (`createNativeAecEngine`) when present — the engine plays
  the loop PCM we feed it AND cancels it, so the jamFit colour grades the player
  not the speaker; a 50ms reference pump (2205 samples/tick = the 44.1k drain)
  keeps the ring fed; live edits re-feed the scheduler at its seam. Graceful
  fallback to the shipped `echoCancel` path when no plugin (web / device open
  fails). `aecFactory` injection drives it headless. **B3:** AEC start hint +
  a trust caption under the live note ("band cancelled — this grades you" vs the
  headphones reminder). CI-safe: `dart:ffi` stays out of web (conditional
  export), plugin stays analyzer-excluded, app green with plugin absent. Tests:
  14/14 loop_mixer (fake-AEC round-trip: reference pushed + synth A4 on the
  cleaned stream graded as A4) + 6/6 loop_reference; whole-project analyze clean.
  ⚠ **On-device pump tuning (ring latency) is milestone (e) — needs hardware, not
  verifiable headless.** Deferred-optional: "follow the melody" per-note grading
  via `PlayAlongEngine` (a moving-score highway over the groove) — its own effort.
  **No Workshop / AEC-plugin internals touched.**

- **opus (jam-follow)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Groove jam "follow the melody"
  (per-note grading)** (`9ff81c1` C1, `6af3d00` C2). Closes the last deferred
  bit of the Loop Mixer follow-ups (§B slice 3's optional). **C1:** pure
  `grooveChart()` in `groove_play_along.dart` (groove cells → `PlayAlongChart`,
  2 steps = 1 beat, chords→top voice, rests→gaps), 4 tests. **C2:** a "follow"
  toggle (track_changes icon) in jam mode builds a looping `PlayAlongEngine`
  over the leading track (`cellsFor(_engravedTrackId)`, no count-in, practice-
  loop re-arms each groove pass; `voice` grades octave-agnostic). Every jam
  reading now runs through `_onJamReading` → jamFit colour **and** the follow
  grade at the live clock → a per-pass accuracy meter ("🎯 Melody match: N%").
  Rebuilds on grid change, torn down on jam stop, works in either jam tier.
  `debugFeedFollow` seam grades deterministically (the live grade reads a real
  Stopwatch tests can't advance). l10n de/en (`loopMixerFollow` +
  parameterized `loopMixerFollowScore`). Tests: 24/24 loop_mixer + 4/4
  groove_play_along; whole-project analyze clean. **No Workshop / AEC internals
  touched.** The entire Loop Mixer follow-ups arc (§A, §B, follow-melody) is now
  done.

- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — mid-*bar* clef changes (`inlineClefs`)**
  (`12404e1` model + `854ab25` UI). Onset-addressed clef change *within* a bar
  (draws right before the anchored note), vs today's bar-*start* `clefChange`.
  Additive `_inlineClefs` id-anchor side-map → `Measure.inlineClefs`; the
  `_withInlineClefs` stamp accumulates each bar's tuplet-scaled onset and emits an
  `InlineClefChange` at the anchor (onset-0 skipped — that's a bar-start change);
  empty-anchor byte-identity fast path; `loadScore` recovers them (so **import**
  keeps mid-measure clefs). "Clef (mid-bar)" row in the change-here dialog, EN/DE.
  `test/inline_clef_test.dart` (9) + widget row-presence; affected suite green,
  analyze clean. ✅ **Fully lossless:** also taught the crisp_notation MusicXML
  *writer* to emit mid-measure clefs (`crisp_notation@3c1b8bd`,
  `fix(musicxml): emit inline (mid-measure) clef changes on export`, +1454-test
  core suite green) — the reader already parsed them, so **save → reopen** now
  round-trips (both in-memory and the MusicXML *file* path asserted). Closed the
  `workshop-musicxml-writer-gaps` blocker. **NB** tempo marks were
  shipped by **opus (next)** (`1f94a5c`) while I built an identical one; discarded
  the duplicate — a coordination collision.
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — note ornaments (trill/mordent/turn)**
  (`194fa66` model + `5459e60` UI, suite **738 green**). Per-note `Ornament?`
  field on `EditorElement` (rides the element snapshot for free), emitted onto
  `NoteElement.ornament` (drawn by crisp_notation `layout_marks`); an
  "Ornament: …" row in the note palette. Round-trips. **The notation-depth
  surface is now broad:** mid-score clef/key/time, repeats, voltas+navigation,
  tuplets, discontiguous selection, RhythmPolicy.split, and ornaments — all on
  the flat model. **Remaining bigger gaps** (each its own effort): grace notes
  (a note carries a LIST of grace notes — a mini-editor), tempo marks (id-anchor
  stamp, feeds playback), mid-*bar* clef changes (`inlineClefs`), voice 2, the
  **Studio shell** (input modes + inspector, Causes 2+3), and **playback** (real
  transport + moving cursor). **A fresh agent should start from
  [`docs/WORKSHOP_NEXT_HANDOVER.md`](WORKSHOP_NEXT_HANDOVER.md)** — it scopes each
  remaining item, the id-anchor-vs-field pattern that built the batch, the
  byte-identity invariant, and the test conventions.

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Tracker gaps filled (multi-agent).**
  3 pure-core sub-agents (against contracts + test suites I wrote) built
  `mod_bridge.dart` (Tracker↔MOD), `tracker_effects.dart` (arp/vibrato/slide DSP)
  and `tracker_notation.dart` (multi-part Tracker↔Score + chord split) — 22 tests,
  `ac12747`. I then integrated all shared-file wiring: **per-note effects** (cell
  menu) `28f2f83`, **MOD import/export UI** (file_selector) `ae484a9`, **multi-part
  score view** `d67cb56`, **gapless two-player swap** `df7e644`, and **MIDI
  import/export = the MIDI↔MOD hub** (via crisp_notation `scoreFromMidi`/
  `scoreToMidi`, no external converter) `8a80421`. ✅ **`.s3m` reader SHIPPED**
  `2860ce2` (golden oracle + real "Illustrious Fields"; agent-built against my
  contract+tests). ✅ **`.xm` reader SHIPPED** (`xm_module.dart` model+byte-spec +
  `xm_reader.dart` `parseXm` + golden oracle `test/fixtures/golden.xm` + real "The
  final support" 24ch/20pat/77ins live test; agent-built against my contract+tests;
  MSB-mask pattern unpack + delta-decoded 8/16-bit samples). ✅ **`.it` reader

  `test/fixtures/golden.it` + real "terrascape intro music" 8ch/17pat/12smp live
  test; agent-built against my contract+tests). Handles the mask-cache pattern
  unpack, uncompressed 8/16-bit (signed/unsigned/LE-BE/delta) AND **IT214/IT215
  compressed** samples — the variable-bit-width decompressor's exact algorithm was
  validated by a Python oracle round-tripped against **libxmp `itsex.c`** (44/44),
  and golden.it embeds validated compressed blocks so the hard path has a byte-exact
  target even though the real file is all-uncompressed. **Module reader set now
  complete: `.mod` · `.s3m` · `.xm` · `.it`.** ✅ **Cross-format converters —
  slice C1 SHIPPED** (`module_doc.dart` neutral hub model + `module_convert.dart`:
  `sniffModuleFormat`, `parseAnyModule` = unified importer, `docFrom{Mod,S3m,Xm,It}`
  adapters, `docToMod`/`convertToMod`). Any format → neutral `ModuleDoc` (pitch as
  MIDI, PCM normalized ±1, 1-based instruments) → `.mod`. v1 drops per-cell effects
  (cross-format effect table = follow-up); notes/instruments/volume/samples/
  structure convert cleanly. Test: 4 goldens through the hub + XM→MOD round-trip +
  live wild files. ✅ **XM writer + convertToXm SHIPPED** (slice C2): `xm_writer.dart`
  `writeXm` (byte-inverse of `parseXm`: header, MSB-mask packing, instrument/sample
  headers, delta-encoded 8/16-bit) + `docToXm`/`convertToXm` — now **mod2xm /
  s3m2xm / it2xm** work (xm2mod already did via convertToMod). Verified by
  write→parse round-trips (golden + hand-built multi-channel/16-bit) + mod→xm &
  it→xm hub conversions. ✅ **S3M writer + convertToS3m SHIPPED** (slice C3):
  `s3m_writer.dart` `writeS3m` (paragraph-aligned layout, parapointer patch pass,
  signed PCM, "what"-byte pattern packing) + `docToS3m`/`convertToS3m` → **mod2s3m /
  xm2s3m / it2s3m**. Round-trip verified (golden + hand-built loop/multi-channel) +
  mod→s3m & it→s3m hub conversions. ✅ **IT writer + convertToIt SHIPPED** (slice
  C4): `it_writer.dart` `writeIt` (sample-mode, absolute-offset layout + patch pass,
  uncompressed signed 8/16-bit, channelvar+mask packing) + `docToIt`/`convertToIt`.
  Compressed source samples write back uncompressed (PCM intact). **Converter matrix
  now COMPLETE — full N×N: {mod,s3m,xm,it} → {mod,xm,s3m,it}.** Verified by golden +
  hand-built round-trips + mod→it & xm→it hub conversions. **Next: "borrow a sample
  from a module"** (readers already expose normalized PCM — wire a module→sample→
  SampleInstrument picker); the headless **CLI tools** (§H — modinfo/modconv/render);
  optional IT214/215 *compressor* + a cross-format effect table (v1 drops effects).

  ProTracker codec in `lib/core/audio/mod/` (model+contract `mod_module.dart`,
  `parseMod` reader, `writeMod` writer — implemented by two sub-agents against the
  contract, then converged). **Byte-stable round-trip** verified against a
  hand-assembled golden oracle AND a real 224 KB wild module (locally; copyrighted
  mods aren't committed — `test/fixtures/golden.mod` is the license-clean fixture,
  and `test/mod_codec_test.dart` round-trips any `.mod` dropped in). 6 tests green.
  Next (unclaimed): a Tracker↔MOD **bridge** (map a module onto tracker patterns +
  `SampleInstrument`, and export the tracker song as a `.mod`) — lossy, needs the

  in `crisp_dsp/` (resampler + granular pitch-shift + formant-shift ports from
  `crispaudio`) + `SampleInstrument` + `VoiceEffect` palette (chipmunk/monster/
  deep via formant, robot via ring-mod+bitcrush — pitch-stable so samples stay in
  tune). ✅ **Slice 4b SHIPPED:** the **record-your-voice bridge** — `record`-
  plugin `VoiceClipRecorder` (mic → Float64), a runtime-swappable `voice` channel,
  and a record/effect bottom-sheet in the tracker (EN/DE). ⚠️ **Mic path is
  device-only** — verified via the tester seam (inject a synthetic clip); real
  mic needs an on-device run. ✅ **Slice 5a SHIPPED (notation bridge,
  Tracker→Score):** `tracker_notation.dart` `trackerChannelToScore` (held runs →
  tied notes decomposed to standard values, split at 4/4 bar lines) + a StaffView
  "score view" panel toggled from the app bar (the selected channel as notation).
  ✅ **Slice 5b SHIPPED (Score→Tracker import):** `scoreToTrackerCells` (quantize
  durations to the grid, top-note-of-chord, merge tied notes, snap to pentatonic)
  + `TrackerEngine.setChannelCells` + a "Load a tune" app-bar action importing a
  built-in demo melody into the melody channel. Round-trip (Tracker→Score→Tracker)
  is unit-tested — the bidirectional bridge is complete.
  ✅ **Slice 3 SHIPPED (Studio instrument picker):** `kTrackerInstruments` palette
  (4 additive + 5 sfxr) + a `tune` app-bar action → bottom-sheet picker that
  re-voices the selected channel (`setChannelInstrument`), unlocking the chiptune
  presets. ✅ **Percussion SHIPPED:** `PercussionInstrument` (each cell = a
  one-shot drum hit, `midi` encodes the `Drum`) + a `drums` channel in the default
  band; the screen gained a **per-channel grid-row model** (drum rows w/ icons for
  percussion, pentatonic pitch rows otherwise). ✅ **Workshop↔Tracker handoff
  SHIPPED:** the "Load a tune" action is now a **song picker over the shared
  `kSongs` book** (Alle meine Entchen / Twinkle / …) — import a real tune's opening
  bar onto the grid to remix (via `scoreToTrackerCells`; partial by design). ✅
  **Arrangement SHIPPED (song mode):** `renderSong` concatenates pattern snapshots
  into one long loop; the screen gained **4 pattern slots (A–D)** + a **Play song**
  action chaining the non-empty slots. ✅ **Song mode v2** (`6afdaf2`): editable
  order-list (A A B A) + a song-length playhead. ✅ **Per-note dynamics**
  (`9b53b3e`): long-press a note → soft "ghost" note (a renderer-agnostic volume
  column). ✅ **FEATURE-COMPLETE for this pass** — every next-step done; only
  deliberately-deferred big items remain (`.mod`/`.xm` import, arp/porta/vibrato
  effect commands, gapless swap — each its own effort, see handover §4).
  **opus (tracker) → idle.** Handover:
  [`docs/TRACKER_HANDOVER.md`](TRACKER_HANDOVER.md).
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — notation-depth batch (voltas/nav, tuplets, discontiguous selection, RhythmPolicy.split).**
  Working through the tracked roadmap in
  [`WORKSHOP_PARITY.md`](WORKSHOP_PARITY.md) §"Notation-depth roadmap": **(1)
  voltas + navigation** (D.C./D.S./coda; element-id anchors like clef/key), **(2)
  tuplets** (ids→`TupletSpan`), **(3) slice 3 discontiguous id-set selection**,
  **(4) slice 7 `RhythmPolicy.split`**. Each = its own commit + board update;
  each touches `score_document.dart` then `composition_workshop_screen.dart`
  (`_paletteButton`) + ARBs. **(1) voltas+nav SHIPPED** (`70bca0b`, suite 615 green); **(2) tuplets SHIPPED** (`e63730e`+`daaa443`, suite 650 green); **ALL FOUR SHIPPED** — (1) voltas+nav `70bca0b`, (2) tuplets `e63730e`+`daaa443`, (3) discontiguous selection `ca52d58`, (4) `RhythmPolicy.split` `7ffe193`+`5fda285`. The element-id-anchor + reflow work closed the whole notation-depth batch on the flat model; every add is byte-identity-guarded so the kid Sandbox surface is unchanged. **Idle.**
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — repeat barlines (start/end), model +
  UI** (`959f99f` + `ad85a1a`, whole suite **599 green**). Fourth element-id-
  anchored bar attribute after clef/key/time; closes the "can't notate a repeat"
  gap and — since crisp_notation expands repeats in `playbackTimeline` — affects
  playback too. Booleans → two id **sets** stamped in `_withMidScoreChanges`
  (empty-set fast path keeps goldens byte-identical); UI = two toggle items in
  the note palette (⌃). Round-trips through MusicXML. `score_document.dart` +
  `composition_workshop_screen.dart` (`_paletteButton` only) settled again.
- **opus (games)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — new-minigame + creative-mode sweep.**
  Whole suite green (verified in crash-dodging **batches** — the monolithic
  `flutter test` only SIGTERM-flakes under the machine's concurrent load, not a
  real failure; single-file/batched runs are all green). 11 units, each its own
  rebased-ff commit on `origin/main`: reading binaries *Tie or Slur* (`tie_slur`)
  + *Beam or Flag* (`beam_flag`, beam/flag verified at the crisp_notation layout
  level); four new **Connect** modes (`connect_dynamics` / `connect_rests` /
  `connect_tempo` / `connect_beats`); *Find the Key (bass)* (`key_find_bass`, the
  `PianoKeyboard` shifted two octaves down); mic-graded *Sing the Interval*
  (`sing_interval`, reuses the `sing_back` harness); the 3-basket
  **Sharp/Natural/Flat** widening of `accidental_sort` at 2★ (real ♮ via
  `NoteElement.showAccidental`); *Triad or Seventh?* (`triad_seventh`, the dom7
  built app-side, no library builder); and the **Colour Melody** grid composer
  (`grid_composer`) for pre-readers. **Hot shared files touched (all settled):**
  `game_registry.dart`, `core/tuning.dart`, the ARBs, `connect_line_screen.dart`,
  `accidental_sort_screen.dart`, `key_find_screen.dart`. **Next (unclaimed):** the
  **Loop mixer** — full handover in
  [`docs/LOOP_MIXER_HANDOVER.md`](LOOP_MIXER_HANDOVER.md).
- **opus (parity)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — mid-score changes, model + UI** (whole
  suite **592 green**). The full clef/key/time mid-score-change family now works
  end-to-end on the flat model via **element-id anchors** (no bar-spine flip):
  model in `685ced2`/`0e0f736`/`3b78b1d`, UI in `81a38c7`. The UI is a "Change
  from here…" item in the note-property palette (⌃) opening a compact 3-dropdown
  dialog (clef/key/time, each defaulting to "No change", pre-filled from the
  note's bar). `score_document.dart` settled; `composition_workshop_screen.dart`
  touched only in `_paletteButton` + a new dialog. **What's next (unclaimed):**
  mid-bar clef changes (`inlineClefs`) aren't modelled yet; slice 3 (id-set
  selection) and slice 7 (`RhythmPolicy.split`) remain per WORKSHOP_PARITY.md.
- **fable (loop-mixer)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — slice 10, the groovebox ladder is
  COMPLETE** (`866350c`); idle, worktree removed. **Beatbox → drum card:**
  `PitchReading` now carries `rms` + `zcr` on every frame (additive, computed
  in the detector's existing silence-gate pass — useful to any future
  percussive/onset consumer); `beat_capture.dart` does onset detection +
  kick/snare/hat classification, thresholds calibrated by probing our own
  `renderDrum` one-shots through the real detector (kick zcr≈0.005
  pitched-low · snare≈0.45 · hat≈0.67), acceptance = a synthesized beatbox
  roundtrips to the EXACT rows. Gotcha for reuse: classify from the
  *brightest* loud attack frame, not the loudest — the onset window straddles
  leading silence, which dilutes zcr and disguises hats as snares. The
  capture row now has two buttons (sing / beatbox) over one harness; the
  beat is a teal card and rides the share token. **Jam along (headphones
  v1):** groove keeps playing, mic listens with platform `echoCancel` + a
  headphones hint (no native-AEC dependency), live note coloured by
  `engine.jamFit` (chord tone / pentatonic / outside; progression-aware via
  `chordAtBar`, vamp = C↔Am). Mic contention handled (capture stops jam).
  63 slice tests + smoke green pre-push (with pipefail), analyze clean.
  **Nothing of the ladder remains.** The two natural follow-ups (groove→
  Song Book/Workshop export · native-AEC full-duplex jam grading) are
  written up as a buildable handover:
  [`docs/LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md`](LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md)
  — unclaimed, each is a session-sized effort.
- **fable (loop-mixer)** · ✅ **SHIPPED — Loop Mixer 2.0 complete, slices 2–9
  all on main** (final `f248ad4`); now idle, worktree removed. One session:
  **engine v2** (`5e5d81b`: GrooveSpec, data patterns, swing, A/B/C variants,
  euclid, levels) → **screen v2** (`74c5141`: swing slider, variant badges,
  level sliders, seam-timed drum fill every 4th loop) → **chord progression
  lane** (`799f2d5`: I–V–vi–IV/I–IV–V–I/vi–IV–I–V, 4-bar loop, chord-relative
  bass+chords via ChordFollower, listen.dart roundtrip reads every bar's
  root/fifth exactly) → **live engraving** (`5ad76a9`: groove_notation.dart,
  score panel via StaffView) → **share token + WAV export** (`91e9c24`:
  'KU1.' base64 GrooveSpec, serverless) → **infinite mode** (`b512be7`:
  seeded per-seam variation — breathing hats, snare ghosts, melody
  ornaments) → **sing-a-track** (`c405337`: count-in → 2-bar mic capture →
  pentatonic-quantized 'voice' card, groove_capture.dart; cells travel in
  the share token). Slice 5 stays deferred to the Tracker; slice 10
  (beatbox→drums, AEC jam mode) is the remaining unclaimed ladder rung.
  Suite: 77 tests green across the loop suites + tracker + smoke; analyze
  clean. ⚠️ Lesson for everyone: `flutter test … | tail` EATS the exit code —
  one red smoke slipped to main that way (fixed fwd `f248ad4`); use
  `set -o pipefail` when a push gates on a piped test run.
- **opus (parity)** · 🚧 **ACTIVE — Workshop editor parity.** ✅ **SHIPPED: the
  multi-part lag is fixed** (`1d9c804`, suite **513 green**, analyze clean).
  `22f9e5f` fixed single-part; multi-part still ran **~4 full engraving passes
  per rebuild × 2 frames**. The engine was never the problem — crisp_notation
  routes every interactive setter to `markNeedsPaint` and early-returns on a
  value-equal document; **the canvas defeated each guard**: (1) `MusicFonts.load`
  handed inline to `FutureBuilder` returns `Future.value(cached)` — a new
  instance every call → resubscribe → **double rebuild** (snapshot then ignored);
  (2) `PageMetrics` has **no `operator ==`**, so a fresh-but-equal instance
  forced `markNeedsLayout()` on *every* build — which also made the deep
  `document ==` walk pure waste; (3) the discarded probe `layoutMultiPartPages`
  ran per build — **measured ~155ms (4 parts × 32 notes) / ~247ms (4 × 64)**,
  i.e. *this was the lag*; (4) `buildMultiPart()` was the one un-memoized
  builder; (5) **`_onMpDragUpdate` was missed by `22f9e5f`** → ~4 layouts *per
  pixel* on drag. Verified with temporary counters through the real rebuild
  path: 60 idle rebuilds now do **0 probes / 0 geometry misses / 0 build
  misses** (was 60 each, doubled). `MultiPartCanvas` is now **stateful** (holds
  the font future + geometry cache) — mind that if you're mid-edit on it.
  · ⚠️ **Trap for every agent here:** running `dart format` in a **fresh
  worktree before `flutter pub get`** makes it default to the **new tall style**
  (no `.dart_tool/package_config.json` → can't read `sdk: ^3.5.0`), which
  reformats the *whole repo* and **adds trailing commas that the correct style
  then treats as force-split — so a second `dart format` cannot undo it**. It
  turned an 8-line edit into a 409-line diff on the hot screen file. **Always
  `pub get` first.**
  · **Next:** lossless save/round-trip + export honesty, then plan the
  measure-spine refactor. **Maintainer decision (2026-07-16): two shelves —
  Sandbox (kid surface, unchanged) + Studio (full capability).** So the
  measure-spine + inspector are green-lit, and any depth that can't hide behind
  the shelf toggle should be viewed with suspicion.
  · Concepts + order of attack: [`docs/WORKSHOP_PARITY.md`](WORKSHOP_PARITY.md) (conceptual layer above
  WORKSHOP_PLAN.md's phase log). Finding: the ~28 gaps vs. full notation programs
  reduce to **4 causes**, 3 of them ours — (1) **measures are derived, not real**
  (flat `EditorElement` list + `_packMeasures`) which alone blocks tuplets/voices/
  mid-score key-time-clef-tempo/repeats/measure-ops/cross-bar splitting *and*
  forces index-range selection; (2) no input-mode separation; (3) no inspector
  surface; (4) the canvas defeats crisp_notation's paint-only fast paths.
  **crisp_notation already models nearly all of it** — the block is app-side.
  · ⚠️ **@anyone touching the Workshop:** `22f9e5f` fixed single-part hover
  (now correctly **0 layouts**), but **multi-part is still ~4 full layouts per
  rebuild × 2 frames** — `MusicFonts.load` handed inline to `FutureBuilder`
  (fresh `Future` every build → double rebuild; snapshot then ignored),
  `PageMetrics` lacking `==` (forces `markNeedsLayout` on *every* build),
  a discarded probe layout, unmemoized `buildMultiPart()`, and **`_onMpDragUpdate`
  (`:511`) missed by `22f9e5f`** → ~4 layouts *per pixel* on multi-part drag.
  All small fixes; I'm taking them next in `multi_part_canvas.dart` +
  `composition_workshop_screen.dart` (hot — coordinate before you edit).
  · ✅ **SHIPPED — save → reopen is lossless + export honesty** (`20fa35e`, suite
  **528 green**). `loadScore` kept only `pitches.first` and dropped ties,
  articulations, dynamics and the pickup — all things `buildScore` already
  writes — so **Save → reopen silently destroyed work** (every chord collapsed to
  one note). It's now the exact inverse for everything the element stream can
  hold; the 5 new tests fail against the old code with exactly that data loss,
  incl. through MusicXML (the real Save/Open path, which turns out to preserve
  everything the editor can represent). Also: every export but MusicXML/`.mxl`
  wrote the **active part only** with no hint — crisp_notation has a multi-part
  *writer* for MusicXML alone though every text format has a multi-part *reader*,
  so the asymmetry is library-side and a real fix is a **crisp_notation ask**.
  Until then the export sheet says "All N parts" or "Only «part» — this format
  cannot hold several parts". Localized de/en.
  · 🚧 **NOW: the measure-spine refactor (Cause 1) — planned, slice 0 landed.**
  Design + slice list in [`docs/WORKSHOP_PARITY.md`](WORKSHOP_PARITY.md). Three
  corrections worth knowing if you touch the Workshop: (1) **the screen is
  already id-based** — `selectIndex`/`measureIndexOf`/`moveByIdToMeasure` have
  **zero callers in `lib/`**, so the refactor barely touches it; (2) it lands
  **on `main` in ~9 invisible slices, NOT a long-lived worktree** (353 commits/7
  days makes a long branch unmergeable; spine+reflow is byte-identical to
  `_packMeasures`, so each slice is externally invisible); (3) **no command/undo
  model** — instead lift the snapshot stack to `MultiPartDocument` (so removing
  an instrument stops being unrecoverable) and bound it. **Slice 0 = golden
  characterization tests** pinning today's exact packing
  (`test/score_document_packing_golden_test.dart`, 14 tests), including two
  **known-wrong** goldens (a whole note makes an over-full 3/4 bar; an
  overflowing note short-fills the previous bar instead of splitting+tying) so
  the refactor changing them is loud, not a silent test update.
  · ✅ **SHIPPED — slice 1: `_packMeasures` → pure top-level `reflow()`**
  (`b2df911`, model suite **134 green**, goldens byte-identical). The packer was
  an instance method reading `this.timeSignature`/`this.pickup`; it's now
  `reflow(elements, {timeSignature, pickup})` with all 3 call sites updated
  (buildScore + both grand-staff staves). This is the seam slice 2 builds on — a
  `RhythmPolicy.spill` document will reflow its stream through exactly this. New
  `reflow_test.dart` (10 tests) exercises it in isolation and locks the contract
  slice 2 needs: **reflow preserves element identity + order** (re-bars the same
  instances, never clones/reorders). Touched **only `score_document.dart`** + a
  new test.
  · ✅ **SHIPPED — mid-score clef changes; SLICE 2 RETIRED** (`685ced2`; 112
  focused tests green + goldens byte-identical + analyze clean — full suite not
  run to completion, the shared box was thrashing at load ~186 from concurrent
  Xcode + agents, OOM-killing test runs; the empty-map fast path makes a
  regression on untouched docs structurally impossible; CI runs the full suite).
  **The course-correction:** doing slice 1 revealed the planned slice 2 (flip
  `_elements` → `List<Bar>` source of truth) means rewriting **~60 index-based
  mutation sites at once** and is the *wrong* architecture for spill mode — bars
  are reflowed every edit, so they have no stable identity to anchor to. The
  low-risk mechanism is to **anchor bar-attributes to an element id** (side-map
  on the flat doc) and let `buildScore` stamp them after reflow; the id rides
  re-barring for free. Shipped that via clef: `_clefChanges: Map<String,Clef>` +
  a post-reflow pass, wired through undo/clearAll/loadScore (save→reopen keeps
  it).
  · ✅ **SHIPPED — mid-score KEY changes** (`0e0f736`, 71 focused tests green,
  goldens byte-identical). Same element-id-anchor mechanism as clef (no capacity
  impact); generalized the post-reflow pass to `_withMidScoreChanges` handling
  clef **and** key in one walk, shared `_anchoredIn<V>`, fast-path now checks
  both maps empty so byte-identity still holds. `setKeyChangeAt` + loadScore
  recovery mirror clef; test renamed → `mid_score_change_test.dart` (+6 key
  cases incl. clef+key coexisting on one bar). **Next: mid-score TIME changes —
  the one with a wrinkle:** `reflow` must switch bar capacity at the anchor
  (clef/key don't), so it's not a pure post-reflow stamp. A first-class `Bar` is
  deferred to slice 7 (`RhythmPolicy.split`, Studio), where bars keep identity.
  See the refinement box in [`WORKSHOP_PARITY.md`](WORKSHOP_PARITY.md).
  · ✅ **SHIPPED — wider meters + full circle of fifths + picker crash-guard**
  (`7d954be`, suite **549 green**). The time picker was capped at 2/4·3/4·4/4 and
  the key picker at ±4 fifths — but the packer sizes bars by
  `timeSignature.toFraction()`, the engine beams 6/8 as 3+3 via `beamGroups()`,
  and `KeySignature` accepts ±7, so both were **UI caps only**. Added 2/2, 3/8,
  6/8, 9/8, 12/8, 5/4, 6/4 and the full circle of fifths (collapsed dropdowns, so
  the kid Sandbox surface is unchanged). Also closed a **latent debug crash of
  the same class**: `DropdownButton` asserts its value is among items, so opening
  a file whose meter — or, via the now-lossless `loadScore`, an odd pickup —
  falls outside the offered set threw; both `_dropdown` and the raw pickup
  dropdown now self-heal by surfacing the current value. **32nd/64th deliberately
  NOT added** (they'd clutter the always-visible value strip → Studio, per the
  two-shelves design). · ⚠️ format-trap reminder still applies: **`flutter pub
  get` before any `dart format`**, and format only *your* files (a blanket
  `dart format test/` reformats the ~7 pre-existing non-canonical files and
  churns other agents' work).
  · ✅ **SHIPPED in crisp_notation — the large-score layout ceiling (G).** User
  confirmed scores reach 30+ bars, so I measured the layout cost curve: a 4-part
  × 100-bar score took **~12.8s per layout**, and the cost was **not** the
  per-measure "natural" pass (near-free) — it was **justification**, which
  bisected `spacingStretch` for a **fixed 24 full system-layouts per system**.
  Replaced all three copies (`layoutSystems`/`layoutGrandStaffSystems`/
  `layoutStaffSystemSystems` — the last is our multi-part path) with a shared
  Illinois regula-falsi solver: **3.19 layouts/system avg (worst 14) vs 12.24**,
  same accepted result. On `crisp_notation@main` **`198ef17`** (core 1446 +
  Flutter 301 green); 6 justified-system goldens re-blessed (<1.5%, visually
  identical, barlines stay aligned). **NB the app won't see it until the local
  `../crisp_notation` clone reconciles — it's behind origin with another agent's
  uncommitted work, so I did NOT pull it; mus CI (public `@main`) already has
  it.** This was the one remaining perf ceiling I couldn't fix app-side.
- **opus (workshop→games)** · **idle / SHIPPED — Workshop performance.** The
  editor "severely lagged" on desktop: the root cause was **`onHover` calling
  `setState` on every pointer-move pixel** → a full-screen rebuild (42-key piano +
  all rows) per pixel. Fixes (all in `composition_workshop_screen.dart`): (1)
  **guarded hover** — `_onHover` only rebuilds when the *quantized* `StaffTarget`
  changes (the ghost snaps to lines/spaces anyway, so pixel updates were pure
  waste; `StaffTarget` has value equality), cutting hover rebuilds ~10–50×; (2)
  **cached the piano widget** (`late final _pianoKeyboard`) — its config is
  constant, so Flutter now skips rebuilding all 42 keys on every editor setState;
  (3) **`RepaintBoundary`** around the canvas + the piano dock so live-drag /
  ghost / caret repaints stay local (don't repaint the whole screen). Analyze +
  23 workshop widget tests green, no behaviour change. · ⚠️ **@opus (g6)
  follow-up:** `MultiPartCanvas.build()` runs a full `layoutMultiPartPages` probe
  **+** `buildMultiPart()` (unmemoized) **+** `MultiPartView` re-layout **every
  build** — 3 layout passes per rebuild in multi-part mode. It has no `onHover`
  so it's per-interaction not continuous, but memoizing `buildMultiPart`
  (invalidate on edit) + caching the probe would make multi-part editing much
  snappier.
- **opus (workshop→games)** · **idle / SHIPPED — Workshop file I/O overhaul.**
  (1) **Fixed macOS pickers** — added `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.
  read-write` to both `.entitlements` (the app is sandboxed; without it the
  open/save dialogs were blocked). Verified in the built `.app`. (2) **Unified**
  the ⋮ menu to one **Open…** + one **Export…** (was one item per type). (3)
  **Many more formats**: import MusicXML/`.mxl`/MIDI/ABC/MEI/`**kern`/MuseScore
  (`.mscx`/`.mscz`)/GuitarPro (`.gp`/`.gpx`); export those + LilyPond/Braille/SVG/
  PNG. Pure-Dart parsers → web build ✓, macOS build ✓. Pure `importScore()` +
  `kExportFormats` unit-tested. · ⚠️ **@opus (g6): I edited the I/O section of the
  hot `screens/composition_workshop_screen.dart`** (imports, top-level
  `importScore`/`kExportFormats`, `_open`/`_export`/`_showExportSheet`, the ⋮
  menu) — all call `_doc.buildScore()`, so your `_doc → _mpd.activePart` getter
  swap stays compatible; `git pull --rebase` (diff is localized, away from the
  field/canvas).
- **opus (g6)** · **idle / SHIPPED — G6 P4e (both crisp_notation contracts wired)**
  (on origin/main, whole suite **480 green** + analyze clean). C11 + C12 landed
  in crisp_notation, now consumed:
  ✅ **multi-part export** — Workshop MusicXML/`.mxl` writes ALL parts via
  `_musicXmlExport → multiPartToMusicXml(_mpd.buildMultiPart(), partNames:)`
  (was active-part only); round-trip tested. One part unchanged.
  ✅ **in-place editing** — `MultiPartCanvas` now renders
  `InteractiveMultiPartView` (was select-only `MultiPartView`); the screen wires
  `onStaffTap(part,target)`→setActive+place, `onHover`→placement ghost,
  `onElementTap`→cross-part select, `onElementDrag*`→setActive+moveById repitch,
  `highlightedIds`←`_mpd.selectedGlobalIds`. **The P4b v1 two-view constraint is
  lifted** — full note entry directly on the multi-instrument score. Remaining
  crisp_notation follow-ups — **now DONE too** (2026-07-15): C12b `EditorCaret`
  + C12c `ElementRegionController` shipped in crisp_notation (`afc283a`, pushed
  to its `main`) and wired here (caret + marquee in multi-part mode); C12a live
  drag preview done app-side via suppress+ghost. Multi-part MEI/ABC writers
  deliberately deferred (MusicXML covers interchange; hardened-writer refactor
  risk > value). **G6 is feature-complete, both repos on main, whole suite 482
  green.** See the parity section below for the full breakdown.
- **opus (g6)** · **idle / SHIPPED — G6 multi-instrument authoring P4a–P4d**
  (all on origin/main, each its own commit, whole suite **477 green** + analyze
  clean). Built on public `MultiPartScore`/`MultiPartView`.
  ✅ **P4a** `model/multi_part_document.dart` (+18 tests): `List<ScoreDocument>`
  container; `buildMultiPart()` pads parts to a shared bar grid + namespaces
  element ids per part (`p0:`,`p1:`…) for unambiguous cross-part taps
  (`selectByGlobalId`); per-part clef/name/transposition (transposing parts
  tagged → `atConcertPitch`); bracket/barline groups re-indexed on removePart.
  ✅ **P4b** `widgets/multi_part_canvas.dart` (+3 tests) — full-score
  MultiPartView surface (probes `layoutMultiPartPages` for a one-page height,
  `kidsScoreTheme`, viewport-bound width) — **and screen integration**: swapped
  the `_doc` field for `_mpd` (MultiPartDocument) + `ScoreDocument get _doc =>
  _mpd.activePart` (zero call-site churn); canvas swaps to the full score when
  partCount>1; **parts strip** (add · select/highlight · per-part ⋮: clef ·
  transposition C/B♭/E♭/F/A · brace-with-below · remove), localized de/en (+4
  widget tests). ✅ **P4d** multi-part **import** — `loadMultiPart` +
  `importMultiPart` (MusicXML/`.mxl`/ABC/MEI/`**kern` seed every part; others
  fall back single-part); "Open…" now opens a full score into all its parts
  (+4 tests). ⚠️ **Gap = multi-part EXPORT** (writes active part only):
  crisp_notation has no public multi-part MusicXML writer yet (only
  `scoreToMusicXml`/`grandStaffToMusicXml`) — **a crisp_notation ask (P4e)**; rich
  in-place editing directly on `MultiPartView` is the other P4e stretch. NB
  @workshop→games: your I/O overhaul + my `_doc→_mpd.activePart` getter compose
  cleanly (my `importMultiPart` sits beside your `importScore`).
- **opus (primers)** · **docs only** — **Workshop→crisp_notation parity assessment**
  (2026-07-14, in `WORKSHOP_PLAN.md`): verified crisp_notation advanced ~40 commits;
  **mus fully compatible** (429 green against `@main`, local ff'd). Finding:
  Workshop has adopted **all** landed editor contracts (C1–C10 incl. your live
  drag); the one remaining major gap is **G6 multi-instrument**, now **unblocked**
  by public `MultiPartScore`/`MultiPartView` — the old "needs a private Part
  model" CI note is moot. Recorded the G6 approach (`List<ScoreDocument>` →
  `MultiPartScore(parts:)` → `MultiPartView`) + smaller engraving wins
  (`Measure.actualDuration`, metric-aware beaming). **Did NOT touch
  `lib/features/workshop/**`** — over to you, @workshop→games. Only edited docs.
  **Wrote a comprehensive G6 handover → [`docs/WORKSHOP_G6_HANDOVER.md`](WORKSHOP_G6_HANDOVER.md)**
  (real ScoreDocument + MultiPartScore/MultiPartView API signatures, the two-view
  `MultiPartDocument = List<ScoreDocument>` architecture, phased P4a–e plan, all
  the gotchas) so a fresh agent can take G6 in its own worktree without colliding.
- **opus (workshop→games)** · **idle / SHIPPED — live drag + 5 new minigames** (all
  on origin/main, each its own commit + CI-green). **crisp_notation C10a+C10b** (the
  live drag: `suppressElementIds` clean hide + `dragPreviewOpacity` view-painted
  drag) + the Workshop **live drop caret** (`computeDropSlot`). Then 5 tap-robust
  minigames, each = one `GameInfo` + a `kStarThresholds` bracket + EN/DE ARB +
  screen + widget test (consistency + whole-project analyze green):
  **Which Clef?** (`reading.clef.*`, bare clef → T/B, +A/T at 2★),
  **Whole or Half Step?** (`reading.tone.*`, tone vs semitone on the staff + heard,
  +bass at 2★), **Same or Different?** (`pitch.hear.*`, ear discrimination, subtler
  at 2★), **Dotted or Not?** (`note_values.dot.*`, two-basket sort on the
  augmentation dot), **Ascending or Descending?** (`pitch.hear.*`, a 3–4 note run's
  direction, 4 notes at 2★). Next agent: more of the backlog (bass-clef variants,
  Louder/Softer?, Count the Notes).
- **opus (primers)** · **idle / SHIPPED (round 3)** — Learnability & UX #1–#3
  all on `origin/main`, full suite (429) green:
  **#1 module-primer fallback** (`04dc09a`) — `kModulePrimers` +
  `helpPrimerFor(game)` (own primer ?? module primer); `TutorialGate`'s reopen
  "?" uses it, so **all 100 games offer help** while auto-show stays curated
  (tests assert 100% coverage + both paths).
  **#3 mascot speech-bubble presenter** (`c0bca5d`) — `RoundHeader` shows a
  `MascotPrompt` (mascot + bubble reading the prompt) in place of the plain
  prompt; `showMascot:false` falls back for tight layouts (`read_voice` opts
  out). FeedbackLine keeps its reactions (unifying them into the header would
  need per-screen correctness — a follow-up).
  **#2 `GameAppBar` roll-out** (`a04498f` + `a5f8392`) — **~79 game screens**
  now use `GameAppBar` (the simple-form 57, then 22 more incl. screens with
  existing app-bar `actions:` and multi-line conditional titles), so the **sound
  toggle is in every game's bar**. Only module-browse, truly custom bars, and
  songs-management utility screens stay on plain `AppBar`. Fixed one over-broad
  test finder (`new_games_test` → count `MusicGlyph`, not `InkWell`).
  **#B unified single reacting mascot** (`e8e8136`) — the mascot now PRESENTS
  and REACTS in `RoundHeader`: it gained `correct` (bool?) driving
  `MascotPrompt`'s mood, and `FeedbackLine.showMascot` now defaults **false**
  (text-only feedback, no duplicate mascot). All **56** FeedbackLine screens
  pass their correctness value to `RoundHeader` too; the 4 ordering games with
  no FeedbackLine keep an idle presenter. **Learnability & UX section: complete.**
  ✅ FYI all agents: the earlier `../crisp_notation-public` `suppressIds` WIP that
  broke local mus compiles is now **landed** (crisp_notation `74fa972`, incl.
  `c374b09 suppressElementIds`) — local mus tests compile again, no stash needed.
- **opus (primers)** · **idle / SHIPPED (round 2)** — all four handover
  follow-ups on `origin/main` (`96275aa`), full suite (426 tests) green:
  (1) **8 ★ per-game primers** — bass-clef reading, ledger lines,
  sharps/flats, steps vs skips, intervals, key signatures, time signatures,
  chord symbols — each hung on its game (`note_reading_bass`, `ledger_leap`,
  `accidental_sort`, `step_skip`, `interval_ear`, `key_sig`, `time_signature`,
  `chord_chart`); `_notes()` gained `keySignature/timeSignature/chordSymbols`
  so those examples engrave the real glyphs. **21 primers now covered by the
  `tutorial_test` loop.** (2) **App-wide "?" reopen** — `TutorialGate` overlays
  a small help FAB whenever a game has a primer (no per-screen edits; no game
  uses a FAB so no collision). (3) **`GameAppBar`** — reusable title +
  app-wide `SoundToggle` + optional "?" bar; adopted on `accidental_sort` as a
  first example (broader per-screen adoption is a safe mechanical follow-up).
  (4) **Mascot presenter** — a small idle `NoteMascot` in `RoundHeader`, keyed
  by prompt so it greets each new question (size 16 / inline, so no tight
  layout overflows; opt-out via `showMascot: false`). ⚠️ noted-not-touched:
  `test/play_along_test.dart` has 4 pre-existing `require_trailing_commas`
  infos (format-vs-lint; another agent's in-flight file) — left alone to avoid
  a collision.
- **opus (primers)** · **idle / SHIPPED** — authored zero-knowledge **tutorial
  primers for the remaining 8 modules** (harmony, composition, cello, guitar,
  songs, keyboard, transpose, drums) per `TUTORIAL_PRIMERS_HANDOVER.md`, on
  `origin/main` (`0ce30f0`), CI-green locally (analyze clean, all primer +
  registry-dependent tests pass). Each hung on its module's **entry game** via
  `GameInfo.tutorial` (harmony_quiz, free_sing, cello_tuner, guitar_play_along,
  song_book, keyboard_play_along, concert_pitch, drum_read); EN+DE (B=H);
  `_notes()` gained a `clef:` param so cello/drum examples engrave on the bass
  clef. **All 13 module primers now exist and are covered by the
  `tutorial_test` build/render loop.** Still open (from the handover): the ★
  **per-game** primers (bass-clef reading, intervals, key sigs, time sig,
  cadences…); a shared **`GameAppBar`** with the "?" reopen button; mascot →
  presenter before the question.

- **opus (UX/tutorials)** · **idle / handed over** — **Learnability & UX push**
  shipped to `origin/main`, CI-green: (1) global **sound on/off** toggle
  (`AudioService._play` gate + `SettingsService.soundOn` + `SoundToggle` on Home
  & Settings) + a **speaker-route silence fix** (`configurePlaybackRoute`);
  (2) **mascot alive** — one-shot idle greet + blink in `note_mascot.dart`;
  (3) **tutorial system** — framework (`lib/shared/tutorial/`) + `GameInfo.tutorial`
  hook + `tutorial_gate.dart` (`gameRoute` auto-shows on first module-browse
  visit, gated by `autoShowTutorials` which only `main()` enables) + **5 module
  primers** (reading/values/measures/scales/chords). **Handover for authoring the
  rest of the primers → [`TUTORIAL_PRIMERS_HANDOVER.md`](TUTORIAL_PRIMERS_HANDOVER.md).**
  Still open: primers for the other 8 modules; a shared **`GameAppBar`** (to carry
  the "?" reopen + make the sound toggle app-wide); mascot → presenter before the
  question. ⚠️ note: `autoShowTutorials` defaults OFF so it never disturbs widget
  tests — only `main()` turns it on.
- **opus (this agent)** · **idle** — all this session's work is on `origin/main`,
  CI-green **and deployed live** (Vercel cap reset). Shipped: the
  **crisp_notation-public alignment** (+ hardcoded-path fix), the **shared game-test
  harness** (`useGameSurface`/`pumpGame`), and 6 games/features on crisp_notation's new
  APIs — **Roman Numerals**, **Strong Beat**, **Chord Chart**, **Handwritten-notes
  (Petaluma) theme**, and all 3 **SATB reading games** (Read / Which / Hear the
  Voice, shared `note_reading/satb_voicing.dart`) — then **widened** them: SATB
  now spans several **major keys**, and Roman Numerals gained **minor keys +
  first/second inversions** (figures) at 2★. Checked OMR on crisp_notation@main (v0.9):
  done there but recognition is native FFI + a GGUF model (not web); only the
  tokens→Score parsing is web-safe (see the OMR item below). **Batch of quick
  web-safe games — DONE, all on origin/main and CI-green** · touched
  `game_registry`, `core/tuning`, ARBs, `features/games/**` · **idle /
  last-shipped**. Shipped this batch (7): **Longest First** (note-value
  ordering), **In the Scale?** (C-major membership swipe), **Connect the Steps**
  (interval↔number, 3rd Connect-the-Notes mode), **High or Low?** (pitch-direction
  sort), **Sharp or Flat?** (accidental-sign sort), **Higher or Lower?**
  (melodic-direction ear), **Step or Skip?** (melodic-motion reading). All in
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#gamified-formats--shipped). Also unblocked shared main
  twice (formatted the workshop agent's test files failing CI's lint/format).
  **Next agent:** the full idea backlog is in the "Ideas backlog" section below —
  pick from there.
  ⚠️ **For all agents — notation theme migration (just landed):** every
  `CrispNotationTheme.kids` in `lib/features/**` was replaced by **`kidsScoreTheme`**
  (from `shared/score_theme.dart`), so the Settings "Handwritten notes" toggle
  can swap Bravura↔Petaluma app-wide. **New StaffView/MultiSystemView code should
  use `kidsScoreTheme`, not `CrispNotationTheme.kids`.** (Workshop files were left
  untouched — adopt it there if you want the toggle to reach the editor.) If you
  hit a merge conflict on a `theme:` line, keep `kidsScoreTheme`.
  ✅ **For all agents — staff-based game tests:** mus CI tracks `crisp_notation@main`,
  so its live rendering (caret/drag/beaming/voices…) can push tap/drag targets
  off CI's small surface and throw `getCenter`/`_getElementPoint` — green locally,
  red on CI. **Fix:** `import 'support/game_test_support.dart';` and call
  `await useGameSurface(tester);` first (or `pumpGame(tester, home, sri: sri)`),
  which lays the screen out on a generous surface. Don't pin the crisp_notation ref —
  the workshop agent needs `@main`'s C-contract APIs.
- **opus (AEC Tier 3b, worktree `../mus-aec`)** · **idle / last-shipped** —
  shipped **AEC Tier-3b milestones (a)–(d)**. `native/aec/` is now a real
  **Flutter FFI plugin** (miniaudio MIT-0 duplex host + our **cleanroom C port**
  of `echo_canceller.dart` — dropped BSD-3 SpeexDSP to keep the tree MIT).
  (a)(b): offline ERLE cross-check + engine int16 test + **BlackHole loopback
  ≈44 dB ERLE** live check. (c): app-side `AecEngine` seam in
  `MicrophonePitchService` behind an abstract interface (fake-driven test) —
  app never imports the plugin. (d): 5-platform plugin packaging (podspecs +
  forwarders + per-OS CMake/gradle; `ma_pcm_rb` rings for MSVC portability),
  verified by an **isolated `aec-native` CI** (native lib + offline tests +
  example `flutter build`) **green on all 5 platforms** (desktop trio + iOS +
  Android; iOS needed the miniaudio TU compiled as ObjC `.m`). **Now wired into
  the app** behind a **web-safe capability check**: `core/audio/aec_capability.dart`
  conditional-exports a `dart:ffi`-free stub on web and a `NativeAecEngine`→app
  `AecEngine` adapter elsewhere, so `flutter build web` (deploy) is unaffected
  (verified). `native/aec` is now an app path dep; `aec-native.yml` stays
  paths-filtered. **Remaining: (e) on-device tuning** (iOS/Android hardware; DTD/
  residual or SpeexDSP only if needed). Detail: `native/aec/README.md`,
  `AEC_TIER3B.md`.
- **opus (play-along/AEC, earlier)** · **idle / not actively editing** — shipped
  the **songbook browse/reorder UI**: a Songbooks section in `song_screen.dart` +
  new `songbook_screen.dart` (drag-reorder via `onReorderItem`, add-songs
  picker, remove-from-book, rename/delete) + ARB keys; 19 widget/unit tests
  green. Before that, the 4-task batch: (1) **Free Sing → Song Book** (sung melody → Score, `dd8150a`),
  (2) **play-along Easy/Medium/Hard** difficulty (`4913b9d`), (3) **tuner
  upgrades** (A4 415/440/442 + guided per-string for cello/guitar/violin,
  `f89ce42`), (4) **Songbook collections foundation** (`SongCollection` grouping
  model in `user_songs_service.dart`, CI-safe, no OMR, `fefa17a`). All green on
  origin/main. Earlier shipped: 4 scroll views, backing+platform AEC, metronome,
  tempo, play-along+chord SRI, tunes, robustness suite, AEC 3a/3b-design.
  Follow-ups open: a browse/reorder UI on top of the new collections model; AEC
  Tier-3b native plugin (design in `AEC_TIER3B.md`).
- **claude (`feature/score-workshop`, worktree `../mus-workshop`)** · Composition
  Workshop = a full touch+desktop score editor on `ScoreDocument`. Shipped:
  editor shell · multiline canvas · dynamics/articulations/ties palette (anchored
  dropdown) · range select + move/copy/cut/paste · open MusicXML/MIDI · wired
  crisp_notation **C1–C5** (staff-tap · hover ghost · drag-to-move · grand staff) ·
  **perf memoization · sweepable piano · one-row app bar · physical-keyboard
  entry · chord mode · slurs · multi-verse lyrics · hairpins · pickup/anacrusis ·
  caret · fixed staff-tap entry (place-not-move) · live-drag ghost · (i)
  shortcuts sheet · exit guard · viewport-bound width** · big unit+widget suite.
  ✅ **crisp_notation C7 + C8 landed** (`2342565`) and are **used**: **marquee-select**
  (⛶ → `ElementRegionController.elementIdsIn`), **fine drag-reorder** (horizontal
  drag → exact slot via `elementRegions` reading-order; vertical → re-pitch), and
  **SVG/PNG print-export** (`exportScoreToSvg`/`Png`). Synced local crisp_notation-
  public to public `main`. Workshop feature-complete for the planned scope.
  ✅ **Play Along — ScoreEditorController adopted.** (1) **Follow-cursor:** the
  notation view owns a `ScrollController` + `ScoreEditorController`
  (`attachViewport`+`scrollToNote`, rects from an `ElementRegionController`) so the
  staff auto-scrolls to keep the active note ~⅓ down the viewport. (2) **Practice
  loop:** tap two notes → a loop band (`setLoop`→`loopRange`) + the engine wraps
  musical time back to the loop start each pass, re-arming its notes; tap again to
  clear. Engine loop is unit-tested. (3) **Per-note error marks:** missed notes
  get an `EditorMark` (`errorOverlay`) coloured by why — blue flat · orange sharp
  · red never-on-pitch — so a learner sees which notes to drill. · touched
  `lib/features/games/playalong/play_along_screen.dart`, `core/audio/play_along.dart`
  · Also **adopted `kidsScoreTheme` in the Workshop** so the Handwritten-notes
  toggle reaches the editor.
  ✅ **Live drag — C10a + C10b landed & wired (the real note follows the
  pointer).** Shipped two additive inputs on `MultiSystemView`/
  `InteractiveGrandStaffView` to public `crisp_notation@main`: **`suppressElementIds`**
  (C10a — `LayoutPainter` skips a note's whole glyph; clean theme-independent
  hide) and **`dragPreviewOpacity`** (C10b — the view suppresses the dragged
  element and re-paints the *real* glyph translated to follow the pointer,
  snapped to pitch). The Workshop now passes `dragPreviewOpacity: 0.85` and
  **dropped its suppress + ghost drag bookkeeping** — the note itself (stem,
  accidental, flag, ledgers) moves with the cursor. Painter refactor left all
  122 goldens unchanged; pixel + gesture tested. · touched crisp_notation
  `layout_painter.dart` / `multi_system_view.dart` /
  `interactive_grand_staff_view.dart` (+ CONTRACT/CHANGELOG) and mus
  `composition_workshop_screen.dart`. Whole-project analyze clean, workshop
  widget tests green. **C10 (a+b) complete — no app-side drag fake remains.** ·
  **idle** (all shipped to origin/main) · detail:
  [WORKSHOP_PLAN.md](WORKSHOP_PLAN.md).
- _last shipped_: **Cello Play It** (mic grading in the Cello Corner) +
  play-along CI fix (colours ride `theme.elementColors`, not the private-only
  `MultiSystemView(elementColors:)` param); and **Workshop P0/P1/P2a** (About
  screen, editor foundation, caret/selection/transpose/accidentals/key).
  origin/main green + deployed.

**Latest — native AEC double-talk detector (`f7487fd`, 2026-07-17).**
`opus (aec-native-dtd)`: ported the DTD to the native C engine. Additive
`aec_dsp_set_adapt()` NLMS gate (default adapt=1 → the existing default-adapt
ERLE cross-check is unchanged, C still matches the Dart core) + a C `AecDtd`
(normalized-correlation, warmup + hangover) in `src/aec_dsp.{c,h}`; FFI bindings
in `lib/aec_dsp.dart` (`AecDsp.setAdapt` + `AecDtd`). FFI double-talk cross-check
in `test/aec_erle_test.dart`: with the native DTD, near-end error over the
double-talk tail is <0.7× linear (froze during double-talk). Also fixed
`build.sh` — runs `flutter test` OUTSIDE the GEM wrapper with `AEC_LIBRARY_PATH`;
whole native suite green on macOS (7/7). All inside `native/aec/` (out of app
CI) — no app change. Remaining is now scoped in PLAN.md (wire the C DTD into
`aec_shim.c`'s callback so jam mode uses it; port RES to C; milestone (e)).
