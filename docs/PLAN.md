# CometBeat — Curriculum & Game Plan

Music notation and harmony for children from primary school onwards (6+),
decomposed into exciting minigames. EN/DE, modularly extendable, running on
iOS/Android/Web/Windows/macOS/Linux. Notation rendering via the MIT
[crisp_notation](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crisp_notation) library (our own).

This file tracks **what is pending and planned**. What's already built and live
is recorded in [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md).

## 🚧 Actively working on (agent coordination — keep in sync with origin/main)

Live board so parallel agents don't collide. **Update this at every checkpoint
and push to origin/main** before/after touching shared files. Format:
`agent · task · files touched · status`.

> Only 🚧 **ACTIVE** entries are live claims — don't edit another agent's ACTIVE
> claim. The long chronological log of shipped board entries has been moved to
> [HISTORY.md → "Agent coordination board — shipped log"](HISTORY.md#agent-coordination-board--shipped-log-chronological).
> **Pending, actionable work is scoped in the two blocks immediately below.**

- **opus (crisp_notation-musicxml)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED (in the LIBRARY,
  `crisp_notation@54538a5`, bumped 0.4.5→0.4.6; `../crisp_notation` fast-forwarded
  so local+CI use it).** An audit of the MusicXML reader/writer (the format the
  Workshop saves/reopens a child's score in) found **2 silent-corruption bugs**,
  both in gaps the 150-score roundtrip property suite doesn't generate:
  (1) **voice-2/3/4 tuplets corrupted BOTH voices** on save/reopen — the writer
  stamped an inner voice's triplet onto voice 1 and wrote the inner voice with no
  time-modification (voice 1 read 3/4 not 4/4); now routed per-voice via
  `Measure.tupletsForVoice`. (2) **a tempo change in a score with no initial
  tempo** was relocated to bar 1 and lost as a change; the reader now treats a
  metronome as the initial tempo only in the first measure. Regression test
  verified to fail on the old code; full MusicXML + 150-score property suite
  green. **@tracker-ui / anyone using `multiPartToMusicXml`/`scoreToMusicXml`:**
  no API change — inner-voice tuplets and mid-piece tempo changes now round-trip
  correctly. MIDI reader audited clean. ✅ **ABC FOLLOW-UPS SHIPPED
  (`crisp_notation@0caafdf`, 0.4.6→0.4.7, `../crisp_notation` fast-forwarded):**
  (a) **octave-specific accidental carry** — `^c c,` no longer imports the lower
  `c,` as C♯ (reader+writer now key the in-bar accidental by pitch+octave per
  ABC 2.1); (b) **sparse-lyric alignment** — a lyric on notes 1 & 3 no longer
  shifts onto note 2 (writer emits one token per note, `*` for unsung); (c) a
  **mid-piece `|]`** keeps its final-barline style. All verified to fail on the
  old code; ABC + 150-score property suite green; mus `import_test` green vs
  0.4.7. **NOT changed (correct-by-design):** the MusicXML endRepeat+bar-style
  item — the reader deliberately ignores `<bar-style>` under a `<repeat>` because
  standard MusicXML writes backward repeats *with* light-heavy, so reading it
  would spuriously mark every imported repeat as a final barline (the field loss
  is cosmetic). **The MusicXML + MIDI + ABC interchange audit is complete.**

- **opus (native-aec-dtd)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — the native C AEC had the same DTD
  deadlock I fixed in Dart.** `native/aec/src/aec_dsp.c`'s `aec_dtd_update` is a
  byte-for-byte port of the pre-fix Dart `DoubleTalkDetector`: `block += 1` ran
  unconditionally before the far-end gate, so warmup burned during far-end-silent
  blocks; warmup then expired with W still zero → echoEst=0 → rho=0 → freeze →
  re-arms forever. Applied the same fix (count warmup only on far-end-active
  blocks; treat ee==0 as "no info, don't freeze"; hold the full hangover on arm).
  Added a native regression test (silent far-end lead-in, echo only) verified to
  fail on the old C: **plain 44.5 dB → +DTD 5.2 dB (deadlock)** — matching the
  Dart ~39 dB regression; now 13/13 native tests green via `bash native/aec/
  build.sh`. Zero collision (no agent touches `native/aec/`). Files:
  `native/aec/src/aec_dsp.c`, `native/aec/test/aec_engine_test.dart`.

- **opus (playing-staff)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "notes light up as they play" across the manual + examples** (`a576ee7`, `9d50d70`). Fixes the gap that examples/lessons played audio with no visible progress. crisp_notation's `StaffView` already exposes `highlightedIds` (repaint-only), and the schedule is always known (each note has a ms duration) — so no library change was needed; the missing piece was a reusable app-side driver. New **`lib/features/games/widgets/playing_staff.dart`**: `ScorePlayback` (ChangeNotifier; `play(List<PlayStep>)` where `PlayStep = ({Set<String> ids, int ms})`) + **`PlayingStaffView`** (a StaffView that lights its scheduled ids on a Ticker created in initState) + `stepsForSequence()`. Wired into: (1) **the whole tutorial/manual** — `TutorialStep` gained a `beats` field; the sheet now uses `PlayingStaffView` and, on Listen, plays `beats` AND lights the score's notes in time (id scheme `n{i}`); **all 41 primer melody steps converted** `playSequence(_run(X))` → `beats: _run(X)`, so every textbook lesson + every game's "?" how-to animates from one change; (2) **both analysis views** — form lights each section's notes, harmony lights each chord. Tests: PlayingStaffView timing (n0→n1→cleared), tutorial Listen lights the score, schedule ids line up with engraved ids. Full suite **1304 green**, analyze clean. ⚠ touched hot shared `primers.dart` (41 mechanical step edits) + `tutorial.dart`/`tutorial_sheet.dart` — rebased. ✅ **In-game sweep started (`1fb36a1`):** `ending_detective` (melody lights note-by-note; `Score.simple` ids e0,e1,…) + `spot_upbeat` converted; **enabler added** so reading-scaffold games can highlight WITHOUT losing the note-name overlay — `PlayingStaffView` gained `showNoteNames`/`noteNameStyle`, and **`ReadingStaffView` gained an optional `playback` controller** that delegates to it. `melody_echo` already had karaoke highlight. Full suite **1321 green**. ✅ **FULL in-game sweep SHIPPED** — every minigame that shows a score and plays a melody now lights its notes as they sound: `ending_detective`, `spot_upbeat`, `melody_echo` (pre-existing), + this batch: **`question_answer`** (two staves — the question lights during the question, the tapped answer during the answer, via one highlighter per staff and a leading empty-id delay step), **`tie_slur`/`beam_flag`/`whole_half`/`articulation_read`/`sync_read`/`triplet_read`/`ornament_read`** (ReadingStaffView + `playback:`), **`enharmonic`/`step_skip`** (StaffView→PlayingStaffView), **`rhythm_tap`** (Score.simple e-ids ↔ beats), **`my_melody`** (dual InteractiveStaff/StaffView — both support `highlightedIds`, driven by a local timer chain since PlayingStaffView is StaffView-only). Only `interval_ladder` is deferred (an N-rung ladder of one-note mini-staves — a per-rung-controller job like question_answer×N, low payoff). **The playback-progress gap is closed** across the manual, the analysis views, and the games. Worktree `../mus-textbook`, branch `feature/textbook-prose-anavis`.

- **opus (tracker-ui)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Advanced Tracker UX + export + Workshop bridge + GUI polish batch.** SEPARATE worktree `../mus-trk-ui` (branch `feature/tracker-ui`) — do NOT point another agent here (the shared `../mus-tracker-adv` collided with the replayer agent). ✅ **SHIPPED (`4de60a9`):** cursor-follow scroll, undo/redo, Save-to-Song-Book spans the whole song (fixed "place some notes first"), removed redundant app-bar Play-song, Clear-confirm, key-hints toggle, "···" tooltip. ✅ **SHIPPED (`bf5656b`): export menu + two-way Score-Workshop bridge** (all over the whole song via the order list): **Export MIDI** (`multiPartToMidi`, format-1 SMF) + **Export MusicXML** files; **Open in Score Workshop** (`CompositionWorkshopScreen` gains an additive `initialScore`/`initialNames` param → `MultiPartDocument.fromMultiPartScore`); **Import score (MusicXML/MIDI)** → new tracker song, 1 chromatic track/part (`multiPartScoreFromMusicXml`/`multiTrackMidiToMultiPart` → `scoreToChannels`, `snapToScale:false`). Refactored into one `_songMultiPart()` shared by Save/Export/Open; `debugExportMidi/MusicXml` seams; 4 EN/DE keys. analyze clean; 19 advanced + 63 workshop tests green. ⚠️ `importMultiPart` is `@visibleForTesting` — used the public `multiPartScoreFromMusicXml`/`multiTrackMidiToMultiPart` instead. ✅ **SHIPPED (`197ff23`+`1bebc35`): FT2-feel batch** (all screen-side, disjoint from the replayer's `tracker_song.dart`): **live record** (⏺ — notes land at the playhead while playing, preserving that cell's vol/fx); in-grid **field cursor** (Tab/Shift+Tab or the ♪/vol/fx button cycle note/vol/fx; hex 0–F in the volume field sets the note's volume; effect field opens the command editor; active column underlines); **interpolate** volumes across a selection (Block menu · Ctrl+I); two-level **row highlights** (beat + measure); Ctrl+Z/Y; **note preview** on entry (hear notes as you type, edit mode). +6 EN/DE keys; analyze clean; 21 advanced tests. ✅ **SHIPPED — "FT2 workflow" batch (SCREEN-ONLY, disjoint from @tracker-replayer):** (1) `f626b47` **FT2 function-key transport** — F5 song · F6 pattern · **F7 play-from-cursor** · F8 stop, in the ⓘ legend. (2) `7f9b692` **editable order list** — select a slot (outlined) + move ◀▶ + insert-copy + delete + retarget ▲▼ (mutates the public `_song.order` directly, no model file). (3) `6f38bf1` **metronome** (`AudioService.playTick` on beat crossings) + **FT2 2-digit hex volume column** (00–40 → 0–64, hex cell display, accumulator resets on move). Each its own commit; 24 advanced tests green; analyze clean. ✅ **SHIPPED (`345e7bf`): authoring UI for the FULL effect-command set** — now that @tracker-replayer plays them. `_CommandEditor` lists every command (arp/porta/tone-porta/vibrato/combos/tremolo/vol-slide/set-vol/jump/break/speed-tempo/extended) + 00–FF param + live hex readout; the in-grid **effect field is directly typeable** (FT2: cmd nibble then 2 param digits, resets on move; Backspace clears) — completing the note/vol/fx field cursor; ⓘ legend gained an effect cheat-sheet. Used canonical MOD nibbles (imported nothing from `tracker_replayer.dart`). Tester seams typeEffect/effectAt; 25 advanced tests; analyze clean. **The tracker now has FULL effect commands END-TO-END** (replayer plays · UI authors). ✅ **SHIPPED (`f5b86bd`): module EXPORT in the GUI** — the tracker overflow now has **Export module (.mod/.xm/.s3m/.it)** via `_songMultiPart`→`multiPartToModuleDoc`→`convertDocTo`→save (public lib fns; no model/engine). Round-trip tested through all four formats. NB via the Score path it carries notes+structure+a generated sample timbre; the authored effect COLUMN isn't in the Score so effects drop (documented). **Conversion coverage now complete in the GUI:** tracker ⇄ module (import + export), tracker → MIDI/MusicXML/SongBook, tracker ⇄ Score Workshop. ✅ **SHIPPED (`a207799`): Tracker as a Workshop MODE, not a game tile** — per feedback, reverted the `tracker_advanced` GameInfo/concept_map; the **home Workshop button (piano) is now a DROPDOWN**: "Score Workshop" (default) / "Advanced Tracker". Reachable: home dropdown + Beginner-tile switch + Workshop overflow entry. Touched shared `home_screen.dart`+`game_registry.dart`(reverted)+ARBs — additive, rebased. coverage/consistency/home tests green. ✅ **SHIPPED — GUI polish batch (SCREEN-ONLY `advanced_tracker_screen.dart`+ARBs; user-picked all 4), all four done, each its own commit:** **(1)** insert/delete row at the cursor + loop-a-selection while playing + follow-scroll toggle. **(2)** `32faa77` classic-tracker LOOK (dark/mono/colour-coded-notes skin) + grid ZOOM (A−/A+). **(3)** `6ff491a` master OSCILLOSCOPE strip (`_scopeStrip` paints `engine.renderLoopPcm()`, cached via `_scopeDirty`, red playhead on the `_row` notifier; toggle in the transport row) + built-in **demo song** loader (`_loadDemo` — a two-pattern call/response groove via the public `TrackerSong` API; overflow menu). **(4)** `fc72a5b` waveform SAMPLE editor in the record sheet — `_SampleWaveform` (peak-per-column render + two drag/tap trim handles, kept region bright / cropped tails dim) + pure non-mutating `sliceFraction(pcm,start,end)` applied first in `_sampleFrom`. 34 advanced tests green (incl. 4 `sliceFraction` unit tests + scope/demo widget tests); analyze clean throughout. ✅ **idle — batch COMPLETE.** **HANDS OFF for @tracker-replayer:** the MODEL/ENGINE parity gaps are YOURS — per-cell instrument column, per-pattern variable length, full effect-command set (your phases 2/3), volume/pan envelopes, panning; I will NOT edit `tracker_song.dart`/`tracker_engine.dart`. Worktree `../mus-trk-ui`, branch `feature/tracker-ui`. **DO NOT reuse `../mus-tracker-adv`** (collided with replayer agent).
- **opus (tracker-replayer)** · 🚧 **ACTIVE — effect-command phases 2 & 3 (the tick-based MOD replayer).** Own worktree `../mus-replayer`, branch `feature/tracker-replayer` (off `origin/main`; picks up phase-1 effect columns `3e7e62e`). This is the "Remaining effect-command phases" the tracker-adv entry below scopes — claimed here so we don't both start it. ✅ **Phase 2 (PITCH commands) SHIPPED locally (not yet pushed):** new Flutter-free `lib/core/audio/tracker_replayer.dart` — a tick-level state machine (`ReplayVoice`: per-channel pitch/volume/LFO/effect-memory across ticks) + a phase-accumulating additive oscillator, implementing **0xy arp · 1xx/2xx porta · 3xx tone-porta · 4xy vibrato · 5xy/6xy combos · 7xy tremolo · Axy/Cxx (migrated per-tick)**. Emits `ReplayResult{pcm, timing}` (row-timing map built now, wired in phase 3). **Trap A solved:** voices sum at fixed-normalized amplitude × gain → tanh (NOT unit-peak per stem), so Cxx/tremolo are audible; gated to the replayer. `tracker_song.dart` gains `usesCommands` → `renderSongWav`/`renderCurrentPatternWav` route through `replaySong`/`replayPattern` when commands present, else the untouched offline path. Non-additive channels fall back to offline whole-channel render (unit-peak×gain). **13 trajectory+audio tests** (`test/tracker_replayer_test.dart`) — pure per-tick pitch/volume trajectories pin every command; audio acceptance via `bin/listen.dart` reads a C4→C5 tone-porta glide that lands exactly at C5/0¢ and a plain scale at 0¢. analyze clean; 40 tracker tests green. ✅ **Phase 3 (FLOW: Bxx jump + Dxx break) SHIPPED locally too:** `walkFlow(song)` expands order→pattern→row under the flow rules (Bxx position-jump wins the order, Dxx pattern-break sets the landing row via the classic *decimal* param; both on one row → jump order + break row) into the exact played row sequence, guarded by a `maxRows` cap so a backward Bxx loop terminates. `replaySong` routes flow songs through `_replayFlow`, which **flattens** the played rows into one long column per channel and renders through the same per-channel path — so pitch commands AND non-additive voices stay aligned with the reordered timeline. `tracker_song.dart` `songTotalMs` is now flow-aware (resolved played length, no-flow path short-circuits allocation-free) so the transport loops/stops correctly. +7 flow tests (exact played-sequence asserts + guard cap + length); real `bin/listen.dart` acceptance: a D00 break truncates a scale to C4 D4 E4 F4 then jumps to pattern 1's C3 (rows 4–7 correctly skipped). **20 replayer tests + 84 tracker tests green, analyze clean.** ✅ **Exy extended + E6x pattern-loop SHIPPED too:** in the tick state machine — **E1x/E2x fine porta** (one-time pitch bump), **EAx/EBx fine volume**, **ECx note cut** (volume 0 at tick x), **EDx note delay** (deferred trigger at tick x — `tick()` now returns a `retrigger` flag; the audio renderer restarts the envelope + skips pre-delay silence per tick), **E9x retrigger** (re-trigger every x ticks); and in `walkFlow`, **E6x pattern loop** (E60 marks the start, E6x repeats the span x extra times, counter state, guarded by the same `maxRows` cap). `songUsesFlow` now also catches E6x. +7 extended tests (trajectory + retrigger-flag + walkFlow sequence); real `bin/listen.dart` acceptance: an EDx note delayed to tick 5/6 stays silent until its onset (~0.19 s) then reads a clean C4/0¢. **27 replayer + 91 tracker tests green, analyze clean.** ✅ **Import MOD effects (handover §7) SHIPPED:** imported `.mod` files now PLAY their effect column instead of dropping it. `DocCell` gained `effect`/`effectParam`; `docFromMod` carries `ModCell.effect/effectParam` (MOD's nibble maps **1:1** onto our `fxCmd`/`fxParam` since our command set is modeled on MOD); `_patternFromDoc` emits a `TrackerCell` with `fxCmd`/`fxParam` for a note **or** an effect-only cell (so slides continue on a ring) → the imported song `usesCommands` → routes through the replayer. MOD carries all 0x0–0xF effects; XM too (its main effect column shares MOD numbering — the letter effects G+ that exceed a nibble are dropped). S3M/IT keep 0 (letter-command numbering — the cross-format table stays a follow-up). +2 tests (precise doc→cell mapping incl. effect-only cells + render; golden.mod carries every parsed effect and invents none); module_convert/notation suites green (no regression from the DocCell field add). ✅ **Fxx SET-SPEED SHIPPED:** `songInitialSpeed(song)` reads the first `Fxx` (param `<0x20`, ticks/row) in play order; `replaySong`/`replayPattern` use it as the render's `ticksPerRow` (effect granularity) — so an imported/authored module replays at its authored speed. Timing-SAFE: speed subdivides the row (tickMs = rowMs/ticksPerRow) so it does NOT change row duration → no `songTotalMs`/non-additive rework. +2 tests (helper reads speed / ignores tempo+none / honours fallback; the speed provably changes the vibrato render at identical length). 100 tracker tests green, analyze clean. Fxx-**tempo** (param `≥0x20`) stays a follow-up: the module's initial tempo is already applied at import; mid-song tempo changes need the per-row-duration rework. **Remaining (follow-ups):** Fxx set-tempo + mid-song speed/tempo changes (per-row duration rework), ✅ 9xx sample-offset SHIPPED (SampleInstrument.renderChannel starts at param×256; +test), the S3M/XM/IT cross-format effect table; and **wire the Advanced playhead to follow jumps** — ✅ **enabler now shipped for the tracker-ui agent:** pure `resolveTimingMap(song)` returns the flow-resolved `(startMs, orderIndex, patternIndex, row)` sequence WITHOUT rendering audio (same map as `replaySong().timing`, proven equal in a test), and `rowIndexAtMs(map, ms)` binary-searches it. **@tracker-ui:** replace the fixed-length playhead math in `advanced_tracker_screen.dart` (~L310–319: `_playingOrder = pos ~/ t.totalMs`) with `final map = resolveTimingMap(_song)` (once, at play start) + `final e = map[rowIndexAtMs(map, elapsed % _song.songTotalMs)]` → `_playingOrder = e.orderIndex; _row = e.row`. That's the whole change; the engine side is done. Also author the new commands (0/1/2/3/4/7/B/D/E/F) in the screen's `_CommandEditor` + ⓘ legend + ARBs. ✅ **Fxx SET-TEMPO SHIPPED (initial value).** `songInitialTempo(song)` reads the first `Fxx` (param `≥0x20`, BPM) in play order; `effectiveTiming(song)` applies it, and `replaySong`/`_replayFlow`/`resolveTimingMap` + `tracker_song.dart` `songTotalMs` all use it, so the render length, the playhead map and the transport all agree (uniform tempo — no per-note rework). +2 tests (helper reads tempo/ignores speed+none; render length + songTotalMs match the Fxx tempo and differ from base). 104 tracker tests green, analyze clean. ✅ **PER-CELL INSTRUMENT COLUMN SHIPPED (additive).** `TrackerCell.instrument` (1-based into the new `TrackerSong.instruments` pool; default pool = the 4 additive voices) + `TrackerSong.usesInstruments` routes such songs through the replayer. The replayer's additive voice switches timbre when a cell names an additive pool instrument (persists per channel, tracker-style) — so one channel can play piano then flute; `_renderChannelInto` gained a `pool` param + a `_timbreParamsOf` helper. +2 tests (default pool = 4; a cell instrument makes note 2 render a different timbre while note 1 stays byte-identical). 106 tracker tests green, analyze clean. **@tracker-ui:** `TrackerSong.instruments` is the pool to expose in the UI (an instrument column / picker). ✅ **PER-NOTE NON-ADDITIVE RENDER SHIPPED → per-cell instrument on SAMPLE voices + imported modules play the right sample per note.** New public `renderChannelPerNote(channelInstrument, cells, timing, pool)` renders a non-additive channel note-by-note, each note played by its effective instrument (channel default, or `pool[cell.instrument-1]` — sample/sfxr too, persists per channel). Each note is rendered over its EXACT run via a dummy cap-trigger, so it's **BYTE-IDENTICAL** to the whole-channel render when the instrument doesn't change (pinned by a regression test). `_renderChannelInto` uses it only when the channel has per-cell instruments (else the unchanged fast whole-channel path). **Module import now wires it:** `songFromModuleDoc` builds the pool from ALL the module's samples (1-based, matching `DocCell.instrument`) + `_patternFromDoc` carries `TrackerCell.instrument`, so an imported `.mod/.xm` plays each note's own sample instead of one voice per channel. +3 tests (byte-identical guard; a cell plays a different pool sample; import builds the pool + carries per-cell instrument, none invented). 138 tracker/module tests green, analyze clean. **@tracker-ui:** `TrackerSong.instruments` is now the real per-note pool for imports too. ✅ **Also fixed:** `setCellVolume`/`setCellEffect` (engine) + `transposeBlock` (song) reconstructed cells and DROPPED `fxCmd`/`fxParam`/`instrument` — now that those columns carry real data that was silent corruption on a volume/effect edit or a block transpose; all three preserve every field (+2 tests). **Remaining:** mid-song tempo/speed CHANGES (still the per-row-duration rework — the last piece), per-pattern variable length, volume/pan envelopes + panning (needs stereo). Refactor the replayer's non-additive channel branch (`_renderChannelInto` in `tracker_replayer.dart`, MINE) from one whole-channel `renderChannel` into a per-NOTE render: walk the runs, render each note with its EFFECTIVE instrument (channel default, or the per-cell pool instrument — sample/sfxr too), place into the channel stem, then unit-peak × gain as today. **Guarded by a byte-identical regression test** for the single-instrument, instrument-0 case (must match the current whole-channel render), so the tested sample path can't silently regress. Then wire module import (`_patternFromDoc` → `TrackerCell.instrument`, pool from the module's samples). Only touches `tracker_replayer.dart` + later `tracker_song_module.dart`/`mod/*` (all mine). **Follow-on (was: needs per-note NON-additive render):** per-cell instrument on SAMPLE voices, so imported modules pick the right sample per note; then wire module import (`_patternFromDoc` → `TrackerCell.instrument`, pool from the module's samples). **Other follow-ups:** mid-song speed/tempo CHANGES (per-row duration rework), ✅ 9xx sample-offset SHIPPED (SampleInstrument.renderChannel starts at param×256; +test), the S3M/IT cross-format effect table (verify vs a libopenmpt oracle). Files touched (all engine/import, **no screen/ARB edits**): `tracker_replayer.dart` (new), `tracker_song.dart`, `mod/{module_doc,module_convert}.dart`, `tracker_song_module.dart`.

- **opus (textbook-prose)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — richer per-concept textbook prose + AnaVis-style form-analysis view** (`2f63709`). Two connected pieces in the **Textbook reader** (the read-through manual). (A) **Per-concept lesson prose** beyond the game primers: `conceptProse(l10n,id)` (`textbook_i18n.dart`) returns the textbook's own teaching paragraph (its voice, our words), rendered atop each expanded `_ConceptTile` above "Read the lesson"; **fallback-safe → null where unauthored**, so coverage grows concept by concept. First tranche = the **17 most abstract concepts** (intervals, triads, key sigs, enharmonics, circle of fifths, minor scales, 7th chords, cadences, harmonic function, roman numerals, modulation, modes, syncopation, triplets, song/musical form, transposing instruments), EN+DE. (B) **AnaVis-style form-analysis view** (fills PLAN §AnaVis as lesson content): reusable `FormAnalysisView` (built on the existing `FormTimeline`) plays a piece's sections section-by-section — tap a coloured block to hear that section (highlight ring), or play the whole; worked `kFormExamples` are **our own abstract A/B/C/D motif renditions → no melody licensing risk** (ternary + rondo for `musical_form`; verse-chorus + AABA for `song_form`), wired into the form concept tiles as a **"See the form"** action. `FormTimeline` gained an optional `onTapSection` (additive; the game stays inert). New `form_analysis_view.dart` + `form_analysis_view_test.dart` (example invariants, screen render+tap, prose authored/null + de/en). **Full suite 1242 green, analyze clean.** Touched shared `app_en.arb`/`app_de.arb` + `textbook_i18n.dart`/`textbook_screen.dart` (additive only). ✅ **Follow-up SHIPPED (`84a553d`): per-concept prose now covers ALL 70 concepts (100%, EN+DE)** — the remaining 53 authored (grade 1–2 opposites; grade 3–4 reading/rhythm/scale fundamentals + the technique/aural/creating/repertoire strands; grade 5–6 clefs/accidentals/articulation; grade 7–10 chord-quality/dictation/phrasing/score-reading/ornaments). `form_analysis_view_test` now pins full coverage (every `kConcepts` id → non-null prose in both locales). Full suite **1264 green**, analyze clean. ✅ **Follow-up SHIPPED (`d3cb309`): the three remaining AnaVis items — score-above-timeline + harmonic-function view + standalone tile.** (1) `FormExample.scoreOf()` builds a real `crisp_notation` Score (one 4/4 bar per section) engraved on a `StaffView` **above** the coloured blocks (barlines line up with sections). (2) New **`HarmonyAnalysisView`** colours a chord progression by function — tonic=home/green, subdominant=away/blue, dominant=tension/orange — with a legend; tap a chord to hear the C-major triad. `kHarmonyExamples`: I–IV–V–I + ii–V–I for `harmonic_function`; perfect (…V–I) vs half (…V) cadence for `cadences`; wired into those tiles as **"See the harmony"**. (3) New **`analysis_view`** sandbox tile (composition module, no stars) → **`AnalysisHubScreen`** ("See the Music") shows every form + harmony example in one page; placed under `musical_form` so coverage stays orphan-free. +20 EN/DE keys; full suite **1272 green**, analyze clean. ✅ **Final follow-up SHIPPED (`6107392`): the deeper harmonic-function overlay.** `HarmonyExample.scoreOf()` engraves the progression as a real score (one 4/4 bar per chord = a whole-note chord via `NoteElement` stacked pitches); the T/S/D colour spans now sit **under that engraved score**, bar-for-bar. Cadence examples gained a **marker under the final chord** (up-bracket + label: perfect = "comes to rest", half = "left open"). +4 keys; full suite **1292 green**, analyze clean. **The textbook prose + AnaVis arc is now COMPLETELY closed — nothing optional remains.** Worktree `../mus-textbook`, branch `feature/textbook-prose-anavis`.

- **opus (tracker-adv)** · 🚧 **ACTIVE — Tracker "Advanced mode" (real-tracker parity) + Workshop entry.** The current Tracker tile becomes **Beginner mode** (unchanged kid pentatonic grid); a new **Advanced mode** reaches ProTracker/ST3/IT/FT2 parity — endless tracks, endless pattern length, multi-pattern songs + order list, full transport (play/pause/stop/prev/next/loop), classic `rows×channels` grid with dual input (keyboard + touch). Built over the ALREADY-general `TrackerEngine` (the "2-3 bars / 6 fixed tracks" limits are UI-only). ✅ **Slice 1 SHIPPED (`daa95f9`):** new Flutter-free `lib/core/audio/tracker_song.dart` (TrackerSong = ordered patterns + order list + shared band; **endless length** `setRows`, **endless tracks** add/removeChannel, **multi-pattern songs** `renderSongWav`; 12 tests) + `advanced_tracker_screen.dart` (classic `rows×channels` grid, hex row numbers, moving playhead + follow-scroll, chromatic tap note-picker, Length 16..128, Add track, Play/Stop on the phase-preserving gapless loop; tester seam + 4 widget tests) + Beginner⇄Advanced app-bar switch + Composition Workshop overflow "Advanced Tracker" entry + 13 EN/DE ARB keys. Acceptance: 2-pattern 64-row song → `bin/listen.dart` reads the exact authored scale ×2 at 0 cents; analyze clean, 91 tracker+workshop tests green. ✅ **Slices 2–4 SHIPPED:** S2 (`2919667`) full dual-input cell editing — an edit cursor + FastTracker-2 computer-keyboard piano map (octave + edit-step + arrows + Delete) AND an on-screen mini-piano at the cursor, per-track instrument picker, per-cell volume/effect (long-press) with note/vol/fx sub-columns. S3 (`7441e60`) multi-pattern songs — pattern strip (new/clone/delete), order-list editor, "Play song" over the order list with the sounding entry lit. S4 (`e1d44a0`) the full transport the user asked for — Play/Pause/Resume (FAB, freezes in place via new `GaplessLoopPlayer.pause()/resume()`) + a Back·Stop·Forward·Loop row + position readout; Back/Forward seek order positions while a song plays (stopwatch base-offset makes it seekable) else navigate patterns. Every stated complaint resolved: endless length + endless tracks + chromatic classic grid + Workshop entry + Beginner⇄Advanced + full transport. analyze clean; 54 advanced/model/beginner/workshop tests green. ✅ **Slices 5a–5d SHIPPED (parity depth):** 5a (`9dfb5f8`) per-channel **mute/solo** (`TrackerChannel.muted` + engine `setChannelMuted`; model tracks user-mute + solo sets, remaps on channel removal; M/S in the channel header). 5b (`fb89f52`) **module import** — new `tracker_song_module.dart` `songFromModuleBytes` imports a full .mod/.s3m/.xm/.it (all patterns/channels/order + per-channel sample instrument via `sampleInstrumentFromDoc`) + **Save to Song Book** (MusicXML); overflow menu. 5c (`c6f6060`) **keyboard/layout modernization** (per user feedback): 2nd note-entry mode (note-names "F"+"2"), the Workshop's sweepable multi-octave `PianoKeyboard`, an ⓘ key legend, Tempo control, length up to **256 + Custom** (not the arbitrary 128), Play/Pause moved INTO the transport row (no FAB overlay), a Step tooltip, and an **optional onboarding tutorial** (i18n de/en). 5d (`3422705`) classic **block ops** — mark a rectangle (Shift+arrows / tap-mark / select-track Ctrl+A / select-pattern) then copy/cut/paste/paste-mix/transpose ±1/±oct/clear, via a Block menu AND keyboard shortcuts; model `copyBlock/clearBlock/pasteBlock(mix:)/transposeBlock`. analyze clean throughout; 71 tracker/model/engine tests green. ✅ **Slices 5e/5g/5h SHIPPED (classic screen furniture):** 5e (`799749c`) **Tracks & mixer** panel — a bottom sheet listing every track with instrument (tap→change), a **gain slider** (`TrackerChannel.gain` made mutable + engine `setChannelGain`), mute/solo, remove, add. 5g (`6e6c7a5`) per-channel **VU meters** in the headers (engine `channelRms` over the cached stem at the playhead → a `_levels` notifier → thin meter). 5h (`4731c57`) **record & edit a sample per track** — a 🎤 record/edit sheet (9 voice presets + slow/fast WSOLA + trim/normalize/reverse) assigns a `SampleInstrument` to the track; reuses `crisp_dsp/sample_edit`+`voice_fx`+`time_stretch`+`VoiceClipRecorder`; device-free `injectRecording` seam. analyze clean; 73→ tests green. ✅ **Effect COLUMNS phase 1 SHIPPED (`3e7e62e`):** `TrackerCell.fxCmd`/`fxParam` (the classic effect column, added ADDITIVELY — Beginner's `effect` enum untouched) + new Flutter-free `tracker_replay.dart` `applyVolumeColumn` implementing **Cxx set-volume + Axy volume-slide** (ramped, persisting; no-op without commands) wired into `_renderWithDynamics`; cells render the hex code (C20/A04) + a `_CommandEditor` (command dropdown + live hex param slider) in the long-press menu. NB the mix normalizes each stem to unit peak, so a Cxx is only observable RELATIVE to a louder note (tests account for this). **Remaining effect-command phases (a from-scratch MOD replayer — large):** phase 2 = PITCH commands (0xy arp / 1xx-2xx porta / 3xx tone-porta / 4xy vibrato / 7xy tremolo / 9xx offset) needing a tick-level oscillator replayer with cross-note period state; phase 3 = FLOW commands (Bxx jump / Dxx pattern-break / Fxx set-speed-tempo / Exy extended) needing a playback-flow model above the per-pattern render. Other optional: per-channel FX-chain UI, per-pattern variable length + row insert/delete, .mod/.xm EXPORT (needs PCM from additive voices), Beginner length extension. Touches shared `composition_workshop_screen.dart` + ARBs — rebasing before each push. Worktree `../mus-tracker-adv`, branch `feature/tracker-advanced`.

- **opus (tts-macos)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — TTS slice 4: macOS `libcrispasr` bundling (dev-verified).** `tool/bundle_macos_tts.sh` collects `libcrispasr` + its **8 deps** (ggml ×5, Homebrew opus/ogg) into a **self-contained** set (copy-by-referenced-name → `@rpath`, strip foreign rpaths to `@loader_path`, sign, + a static self-containment check). `KokoroModelStore.libPath()` gains a cascade (override → `.app` Frameworks → `~/.cache/crispasr` → default). **Verified: synth runs through the bundled set with only `@loader_path`** (loads the bundle's ggml, not the machine's) → portable. Dev: run the script → `flutter run macos` → HD tile appears. `docs/TTS_MACOS.md` (dev + release Frameworks embed + App-Store caveats); cascade unit-tested; analyze clean. **Shared `macos/` Xcode project NOT touched** (multi-agent safety) — new files only (`tool/`, `docs/`, store cascade). Remaining: release `.app` embed + iOS/Android/web.

- **opus (tts-settings)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — TTS slice 3: the "Natural voice (HD)" settings tile.** A tile in Settings (below the sound switch) that opt-in **downloads the ~135 MB Kokoro model** (`backend.download()` → CrispASR's registry+`cacheEnsureFile`) with a spinner, then "On ✓"; once cached, narration auto-upgrades to the neural voice. `TtsService` gains `hasNeural`/`neuralSupported`/`neuralReady`/`downloadNeuralVoice`; `NeuralTts` holder carries `supported`+`download`. **Shown only where libcrispasr loads** (invisible until it's bundled per platform), and degrades gracefully with no TtsService (settings tests untouched). EN/DE ARB; 24 TTS/settings tests green; analyze clean. Touched shared `main.dart`+ARBs+settings — rebased. Remaining TTS work: per-platform lib bundling (macOS first).

- **opus (tts-crispasr)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — TTS slice 2: CrispASR/Kokoro NEURAL backend via CrispASR's OWN registry + downloader.** Behind the `TtsBackend` seam: `crispasr_tts_backend.dart` (crispasr pub FFI → libcrispasr → **Kokoro**, Apache-2.0; a background-isolate `runKokoroJob` resolves via `registryLookup` + downloads via `cacheEnsureFile` = the CLI's `-m auto` path; `synthesize` → PCM16 → `wavBytes` → `AudioService.playWavBytes`) + `kokoro_model_store.dart` (**no hand-rolled URLs** — the GGUFs are already published at `cstr/kokoro-82m-GGUF` + `cstr/kokoro-voices-GGUF`; cached into `~/.cache/crispasr`; `isReady` = lib+model cached) + `tts_neural.dart` conditional facade (**web null stub**). Download is **consent-gated** (playback never fetches; `backend.download(lang)` is the opt-in). `TtsService` prefers neural when ready, else flutter_tts. **Verified**: registry→published cstr URL resolves from the app dep, + REAL macOS synth (libcrispasr.dylib → valid German audio); download ABI symbols present. 16 TTS tests green, analyze clean. Dep `crispasr: ^0.8.11` (pub.dev) → CI needs no native lib. Remaining: a settings "Download voice" trigger; per-platform lib bundling (macOS first). Detail in TTS section. Touched shared `main.dart`+`pubspec` — rebased.

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — multi-part MIDI/ABC export in the
  Workshop** (`4210a62`). MIDI + ABC now write EVERY instrument part, not just the
  active one. New pure-notation `lib/core/notation/multi_part_export.dart`
  (`multiPartToMidi` = format-1 SMF one track/part; `multiPartToAbc` = one `V:`
  voice/part; + split/merge), `module_notation.dart` re-exports it.
  `composition_workshop_screen._generateExport` routes mid→multiPartToMidi,
  abc→multiPartToAbc when partCount>1; `kExportFormats` marks MIDI+ABC multiPart;
  new `debugGenerateExport` seam. MEI/kern/MuseScore/LilyPond stay single-Score
  (library writers). 63 workshop + 30 notation tests green. **Follow-up
  (`7455c14`): multi-track MIDI IMPORT** — `multiTrackMidiToMultiPart` (one part
  per MTrk); wired into `notaconv` (a `.mid` with >1 track → all parts →
  module/xml/abc) + the Workshop's `importMultiPart`. MIDI import/export now
  symmetric. Live: 24-track MIDI → 24 channels/parts/voices. **Follow-up
  (`67655a3`): Tracker → Song Book** — a "Save to Song Book" menu item saves the
  groove's pitched channels as multi-part MusicXML (`trackerToScoreParts` →
  `multiPartToMusicXml` → `UserSongsService`), mirroring the Loop Mixer;
  `debugSaveToSongBook` seam + 3 ARB keys. The Tracker now exports to MOD / MIDI /
  Song Book.

- **opus (modes)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Which Mode?" ear game (`mode_ear`, scales module).** 3-way ear game: a scale plays ascending as Major (Ionian) / natural Minor (Aeolian) / **Dorian** (minor with a raised 6th, built from exact semitone steps); child taps which. `modePrimer` teaches the three colours (shown + heard). **Closes the `modes` gap** in concept_map. Scales module; EN/DE; [100,600,900]; analyze clean; mode_ear + tutorial + curriculum_coverage + consistency tests green (14). New: `mode_ear_screen.dart`, `test/mode_ear_test.dart`, `modePrimer`. (Also fixed a stray pre-existing import-order lint in game_registry.)

- **opus (modulation)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Key Change?" ear game (`modulation_ear`, scales module).** Binary ear game: a C-major phrase either stays in one key or has its second half lifted a perfect 4th/5th to a new tonic; child taps Same key / Key changed. Correct replays the phrase; own SRI `scales.modulation.<same|changed>`. `modulationPrimer` teaches it by ear (stay vs move). **Closes the `modulation` gap** in concept_map (2 gaps left: modes, instrument families). EN/DE; analyze clean (pre-existing composition import-order info untouched); modulation_ear + tutorial + curriculum_coverage + consistency tests green.

- **opus (tts)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — TTS narration, slice 1 (read lessons/instructions aloud).** New `core/services/tts_service.dart`: a `TtsBackend`-abstracted, locale-aware (de-DE/en-US), sound-gated `TtsService` on `flutter_tts` (platform voices — on-device, offline, free). A **🗣 read-aloud button in the shared tutorial sheet** narrates the current step, so **both** textbook lessons and every game's how-to primer get it from one change. Provided in `main.dart` (soundOn synced from settings); degrades safely when unprovided. New dep `flutter_tts: ^4.2.2` (⚠ `pod install` before next Apple build; CI unaffected). Touched shared `main.dart`+ARBs+pubspec — rebased. `tts_service_test` (fake backend) + tutorial tests green; analyze clean (lib+test). CrispTTS = Python-CLI neural engines; the `TtsBackend` seam is left ready for a lightweight ONNX voice (Kokoro/Piper via onnx_runtime_dart) later.

- **opus (textbook-p3)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Textbook phase 3: narrative + full i18n.** New `features/textbook/textbook_i18n.dart` (ARB-backed, de/en) localises **all 70 concept titles**, the **19 concept-area sub-headers** and **5 grade-band short labels**, plus a **narrative intro paragraph per grade band**. The reader now groups each band's concepts **by area** (sub-headers, first-appearance order) with an italic band intro on top, so it reads like a book. +94 ARB keys ×2 (concept/area/band) +5 label keys ×2, generated from one source of truth. Touched shared ARBs — kept both key sets on rebase. Analyze clean (lib+test); textbook (now incl. a **de-locale** assertion) + curriculum tests green. Also logged the **TTS-narration (CrispASR)** follow-up in PLAN.

- **opus (textbook-ui)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — read-through Textbook reader.** New `features/textbook/textbook_screen.dart` walks the grade-1–10 concept map band by band; each concept expands to its **lesson** (the game's primer via `showTutorial`/`helpPrimerFor`) + **practise** links (`gameRoute`) to its games; untrained concepts show "coming soon", so the reader stays honest as gaps fill. Home app-bar gets a 📖 Textbook button. Reuses the primers as lesson content (phase 0 work). EN/DE chrome; concept titles English for now (l10n a follow-up). New files + home entry + 5 ARB keys; analyze clean; 2 widget tests green. (Textbook phase 4 — the reader UI.)


- **opus (form-view)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — AnaVis-style form view + "Label the Form".** Reusable `FormTimeline` widget (colour-coded, labelled section blocks — same colour = same tune; `showLabels` off at 2★). `form_read` game: hear a piece's sections (each a distinct motif) as a coloured timeline and pick the form (ABA/AAB/ABC at 1★; AABA/ABAB/ABAC/rondo at 2★). `formPrimer` teaches A-B-A by ear. **Closes 2 gaps** (`musical_form` + `song_form`) in concept_map. Composition module; EN/DE; 19 tests green; analyze clean. **3 gaps left:** modes, modulation, instrument families.

- **opus (bughunt-2)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — 2nd bug-hunt wave (new subsystems).**
  Four reviewers over scoring/SRI, Workshop serializers, crisp_notation theory,
  and game answer-generation. **crisp_notation theory core = clean** (verified the
  enharmonic edges: B dim7→A♭, ø7 vs °7, 6–7-accidental keys, secondary-dominant
  labels — all correct + test-pinned). **5 real defects found, fixed + pinned:**
  1. **Streak breaks on spring-forward DST** (`50fbdd4`) — `currentStreak` walked
     back with `subtract(Duration(days:1))` (24 h absolute); the day after
     spring-forward has 23 h, so it skipped the short day and the streak silently
     broke. German (CET/CEST) audience → every spring. Now walks by calendar day.
  2. **Scale Detective could be unsolvable** (`29d5c6d`) — a harmonic-minor round
     could pick the raised 7th as the odd note and neutralize its accidental
     (G♯→G in A minor), rendering a plain valid natural-minor scale with no odd
     note. ~1/6 of minor rounds, every minor tonic. Wrong-note pick now excludes
     the raised leading tone (keeps it as the intended distractor).
  3–5. **Workshop silent data loss** (`34d01de`) — `_splitPiece` dropped
     ornament/grace/accidental/fingerings from every tied piece; `_reid` dropped
     the same for every note in multi-part assembly; `_reindex` left voice-2 ids
     unprefixed so voice-2 dynamics/lyrics detached (and collided across parts).
     All three lost data on render/export/reopen. Fixed + regression-tested.
  Grand total across both waves: **13 real defects found, fixed, and pinned;
  theory core + most game/scoring paths verified clean.**

- **opus (instrfam-game)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Which Family?" (`instrument_family`, songs module) closes the `instrument_families` gap.** Reading/knowledge MC quiz: an instrument is named (~19 well-known ones) → tap its orchestral family (Strings/Woodwind/Brass/Percussion/Keyboard); deliberately no timbre-ID audio. `instrumentFamilyPrimer` names the families with examples. SRI `timbre.family.<family>`; 10 rounds, [100,600,900]; EN/DE. `concept_map` now trains instrument_families (0 orphans; only modulation + modes remain untrained). 14 tests green (incl. curriculum_coverage + consistency + tutorial); analyze clean (one pre-existing `form_read` import-order info in game_registry is not ours).

- **opus (gap-games)** · 🚧 **ACTIVE — filling the 8 untrained-concept gaps**. ✅ **Batch A SHIPPED (3 gaps closed):** `sync_read` (On the Beat or Off? — straight vs syncopated, heard via displaced note lengths), `triplet_read` (Even or Triplet? — a real `TupletSpan`, 2-vs-3 split heard), `ornament_read` (Which Ornament? — trill/mordent/turn read + a flourish played). Each with a 9yo-bar primer (`syncopationPrimer`/`tripletPrimer`/`ornamentPrimer`, shown + heard) and wired into `concept_map` (coverage: those 3 concepts now trained). 20 tests green; analyze clean. **Remaining 5 gaps:** musical form (→ AnaVis-style view + label-the-form), verse/chorus form, modulation, modes, instrument families. Worktree `../mus-gaps`, branch `feature/gap-games`.

- **opus (textbook-p2)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — song mnemonics + orphan-game
  placement.** (1) `core/curriculum/interval_songs.dart` — interval-mnemonic table
  (Kuckuck = falling minor 3rd; Alle-meine-Entchen = major 2nd up; …) with a test
  that each demo's notes span exactly the stated interval + direction; a Kuckuck
  step added to `intervalsPrimer` (shown + heard). (2) **Placed all 56 orphan
  games** — not Zeitvertreib but the practical strands the theory map omitted:
  added `ConceptArea.technique` (keyboard/cello/guitar/percussion corners),
  `aural` (sing/echo), `creating` (compose/arrange), `repertoire` (real songs), a
  `reading_fluency` concept, and attached the bass/theory twins to their existing
  concept. **Coverage 74/130 → 130/130 placed (0 orphans), 70 concepts**; the gap
  report now shows only the 8 truly-untrained concepts. EN/DE; analyze clean; 9
  tests green.

- **opus (textbook-p1)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Textbook phase 1: concept inventory + gap analysis.** `core/curriculum/concept_map.dart` (60 grade-1–10 concepts, our words) + `coverage_gaps.dart` + a test that PRINTS the gap report and guards no-dangling-refs. **Reveals the 8 untrained concepts** (verse/chorus form, syncopation, triplets, ABA/rondo form, modulation, ornaments, modes, instrument families), many thin (1-game) concepts, and 56 orphan games; 74/130 games placed. Also wrote up the **bachelor-level extension + OER-source licence registry** (GFDL/NC = facts-only; CC-BY(-SA) = adaptable) and an **AnaVis-style form-analysis view** idea (fills the form gap). Pure Dart + test, no game/UI touch. Analyze clean; 3 tests green.

- **opus (primer-quality)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — primers revised to the 9yo bar + textbook-mode spec**. Audit found `cadencePrimer` had NO notation (both steps audio-only) and unexplained "V/I"; `upbeat`/`enharmonic`/`voices` each had an audio-only step; `seventh`/`phrase` used jargon. Fixed: **every step now has an engraved example** (new helpers `_progression` cadences, `_pickup` shows a real anacrusis bar, `_spelled` shows F♯ vs G♭ at their true staff spots), and the jargon ("V then I", "the tonic", "a third apart: root/third/fifth") is now concrete kid language. Also **wrote up the Textbook / read-through curriculum vision** (new section above `## Delivery`) incl. the Bundesländer-licensing constraint, the song-mnemonic examples (Kuckuck = descending minor 3rd), and the gap-analysis method. Analyze clean; tutorial + gate green.

- **opus (bughunt)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — 4 real defects found by an adversarial
  audit of the numeric core.** Each verified by running the code before/after,
  each pinned by a regression test proven to fail on the old code:
  1. **`pitch_analysis`: octave-halving above ~1503 Hz** (`ff5dde1`). The
     key-maxima scan started at `minLag`, not 1; the NSDF crossing that opens the
     fundamental's segment sits at ~3T/4, which for short periods is *below*
     minLag → the peak at T was skipped and 2T won. `1600→800, 1760→880,
     2000→1000, 2100→1050`, all at **clarity 1.00**. Broke the top quarter of the
     detector's own declared range; the suite topped out at A5 so it never saw it.
  2. **`chroma_analysis`: the silence gate gated nothing** (`ff5dde1`). It summed
     the *peak-normalized* chroma → scale-invariant → only bit-exact silence ever
     gated. A triad at amp 1e-9 scored identically to 0.5; near-silent noise was
     emitted as a confident "A#maj7 (68%)". Now gated on absolute band level.
  3. **`loop_engine`: unvalidated tempo from a share token** (`a0a94e5`). Every
     other spec field is validated; tempo passed raw into `60000 ~/ tempoBpm`.
     `t:0`→IntegerDivisionByZero, `t:-100`→negative buffer RangeError,
     `t:60001`→ticker modulo-by-zero every frame, `t:1`→42 MB WAV on the UI
     thread. Clamped to 40..240 at both entry points.
  4. **`aec_offline`: DTD deadlocked the filter** (`8d803ee`). Warmup counted
     far-end-*silent* blocks (where the filter can't converge), so it expired with
     W zero → ee=0 → rho=0 → freeze → W can never adapt → frozen forever. ~280 ms
     of capture-before-playback (the normal case) cost **~28 dB for the session**.
     Every existing DTD test had the far-end active from block 0.

  ✅ **FOLLOW-UP SHIPPED — formantShift is now a real formant shifter.** It scaled
  *time-domain* indices (= a resample = a PITCH shift), breaking `voice_fx`'s
  pitch-preserving contract: a recorded C4 came back at chipmunk +608¢, monster
  −1893¢, deep −368¢, demon −1892¢. Time-domain resampling *cannot* decouple
  envelope from pitch, so it's now a real STFT method (Hann 75% overlap →
  cepstral-liftered envelope → warp → magnitude-only gain, phase untouched →
  harmonics stay put → pitch preserved; ifft → COLA overlap-add). All four are now
  **0¢** and the centroid moves the right way (dry 1130 Hz → +0.5: 1527, −0.5:
  755). Also fixed en route: a 0.7-peak voice came out at **2.12** (hard clipping
  in PCM16) → capped to the input peak, attenuate-only; and clips under 512
  samples returned **pure silence** (`frameCount = len ~/ hop` skipped the loop)
  → now processed. **Honest split recorded in the contract:** `robot`/`alien`/
  `cyborg` use ring modulation (f → f ± carrier), which *by construction* cannot
  preserve pitch — the old "ALL presets are pitch-preserving" doc was a lie about
  those three independently of this bug. New `kPitchPreservingVoiceEffects` makes
  the in-tune subset testable, and a test pins that every preset is classified.
  `sample_dsp_test` grew the pitch/centroid/level/short-input assertions it never
  had (the old "changes the content" check passed happily on a transposed
  signal); verified to fail on the old code ("shift 0.5 moved the pitch by 608¢").
  84 consumer tests green.

  ✅ **FOLLOW-UPS SHIPPED — the three smaller open items are all fixed:**
  • `siSdrDb` floored a silent estimate to **−120 dB** (was a false 0 dB that
    out-ranked a noisy-but-real estimate).
  • `LoopSend.delay/reverb` now **pre-roll one loop** so the render is the
    periodic steady state (was 36.9 %/5.5 % off; now 0.00 % vs a 3-copy
    reference) — no more "echo drops out on the downbeat".
  • Swing **snaps to the 10 ms grid** in `LoopTiming._swingMs`, so every stem is
    sample-exact at all tempos/swing (was ≤8-sample drift; the guarding test
    passed by luck). Slider gained `divisions: 12`. The swing test now sweeps the
    drift-prone tempo×swing grid; a new seam test pins the send steady state.
  **The core bug hunt is now fully closed — 8 defects found, all fixed + pinned.**

- **opus (aec-rate)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED (layers 1,2,3,4 of 4) —
  self-tuning AEC: Valin closed-loop rate + automatic tuner + REAL corpus**. The
  full automatic-tuning answer, end to end, now on real acoustics.
  **Layer 3 (real corpus) DONE**: `buildCorpusFromAssets` (corpus.dart) builds
  ground-truth scenarios from **real measured room IRs** (MIT IR Survey, CC-BY) ×
  **real cello** (U. Iowa MIS, unrestricted) — `--rir-dir/--cello-dir`. RIR
  truncated to its early field (~90 ms, the cancellable part), echo
  level-calibrated (measured IRs aren't normalized), near-end note DETECTED (not
  assumed). **On the real corpus (6 rooms × 3 cello runs, 54 notes): untuned
  adaptive 3.4 dB SI-SDR / 74% notes → tuned 9.0 dB / 94%** (+5.6 dB). Lower than
  synthetic (honest — real rooms are harder); rateGamma settles INTERIOR (0.36),
  not pinned. Assets on `/Volumes/backups/ai/aec_corpus/` (never checked in;
  eval-only). CI-safe loader test (synthetic WAVs in a temp dir).
  **Modelled loudspeaker nonlinearity (`--nonlin clip|tanh --drive N`)**: a
  memoryless Hammerstein distortion on the reference before the echo path (how
  the AEC Challenge synthesizes nonlinear echo; RMS-held so the cost is
  distortion not gain). AEC sees the clean ref → harmonics uncancellable by a
  linear filter. The CLI reports the cost + whether RES recovers it. **On the
  real corpus, hard-clip drive 4: note-survival 74% → 30% (SI-SDR 3.4 → 0.2 dB),
  then +RES recovers to 87% / 4.7 dB** — a concrete case for RES under a driven
  speaker. It's a MODEL not measured. 3 tests (passthrough, RMS-held+shape-
  changed, distortion-costs-then-RES-recovers). **Only realism gap left: MEASURED
  speaker/mic nonlinearity → a real device capture (on-device milestone (e)).**
  **Layer 4 (CMA-ES auto-tuner) DONE**: `bin/aec_tune.dart` + `bin/aec_tune/`
  (CLI-only, out of the app). A ground-truth corpus (`corpus.dart`, parametric
  rooms — measured-RIR swap is drop-in), a domain objective (`objective.dart` —
  note-survival + double-talk SI-SDR, NOT speech-MOS, per the handover's
  "judge by the decoded outcome"), and a separable CMA-ES (`cmaes.dart`,
  verified against sphere + ill-conditioned ellipsoid). Tunes the rate's own
  hand-picked constants (rateGamma/rateBeta0/rateMuMax — the paper leaves
  gamma/beta0 unspecified). **Result on the synthetic corpus:** untuned adaptive
  8.9 dB SI-SDR / 83% notes → tuned **20.4 dB / 100%** (+11.5 dB), also +10.5 dB
  over fixed-`mu`. gamma/beta0 pin to their bounds (corpus wants extremes → real
  corpus + wider bounds is the follow-up). 5 tests (optimizer correctness,
  corpus/objective sanity, end-to-end loop ≥ baseline).
  **Layer 2 (C port) DONE** (`610acb2`): `AecRate` in `native/aec/src/aec_dsp.c`
  mirrors the Dart `AdaptiveLearningRate`; attach via `aec_dsp_set_rate` (NULL =
  fixed-`mu` path, byte-identical — the property `aec_erle_test` pins). FFI
  binding + 2 new cross-check tests. NOT wired into `aec_shim`/`aec_engine`
  (on-device milestone (e)).
  Layer 1 detail: Instead of hand-picking
  `mu`, the filter derives its own step per bin per block from its live leakage
  estimate — Valin, "On Adjusting the Learning Rate in Frequency Domain Echo
  Cancellation With Double-Talk" (IEEE TASLP 2007, arXiv:1602.08044), written
  from the paper, not SpeexDSP (MIT-clean). New `AdaptiveLearningRate`
  (echo_canceller.dart): `mu_opt(k)=min(eta·|Yhat(k)|²/|E(k)|², muMax)` with eta
  (=1/ERLE) estimated by regressing DC-rejected error power on echo-estimate
  power. Opt-in via `EchoCanceller(rate:)` / `AecTuning(adaptiveRate:true)` /
  `--adaptive-rate`; the fixed-`mu` path (which the C port + `aec_erle_test`
  pin) is byte-identical when off. **Result:** on synthetic double-talk the
  *linear* canceller alone jumps 8.8→33.1 dB SI-SDR — beating fixed-`mu`+DTD
  (15.9 dB) by 17 dB with NO DTD/freeze/threshold, and the rate collapses on
  near-end (mean step 0.40→0.13) then recovers. Trade-off: slower convergence
  (~0.9 s vs ~0.1 s), hence opt-in. 6 new tests pin the behaviour (rate
  collapse, filter-survives-DT, subsumes-DTD, 1/ERLE identity, off-by-default).
  Files: `lib/core/audio/echo_canceller.dart`, `aec_offline.dart`, `bin/aec.dart`,
  `test/aec_offline_test.dart`. Worktree `../mus-aec-rate`, branch
  `feature/aec-adaptive-rate`. **Next in this arc:** port the rate control to
  `native/aec/src/aec_dsp.c` (keep `aec_erle_test` green); then a real corpus
  (record-separately-and-sum through the physical speaker→mic path, + measured
  RIRs / AEC-Challenge set) and a CMA-ES sweep over surviving constants scored on
  note-survival + SI-SDR (AECMOS as cross-check via the existing `bin/aecmos`).

- **opus (aec-tune)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — AEC tuning knobs reachable from the
  CLI / pipe**. The pipe harness existed but only exposed `--delay/--rate/--dtd/
  --res`: `cancelEcho` and `StreamingEchoCanceller` built `EchoCanceller()`,
  `DoubleTalkDetector()` and `ResidualEchoSuppressor()` with hard-coded defaults
  and forwarded nothing, so a sweep over `mu`/`leak`/`blockSize`/DTD/RES meant
  editing source. New **`AecTuning`** (aec_offline.dart) mirrors all 16 stage
  knobs + `createCanceller/Detector/Suppressor()` + `describe()` (names only the
  non-defaults — every CLI run prints it, so a sweep's output says which point
  produced which number). Both entry points take `tuning:`; `blockSize` moved
  into it (the one caller updated). `bin/aec.dart` gained a flag per knob
  (`--mu`, `--block`, `--leak`, `--dtd-threshold`, `--res-gain-floor`, …) in all
  three modes (selftest/files/stdin). Verified over a real pipe: mu 0→0.0 dB,
  0.1→7.2, 0.3→12.7, 0.7→16.0, 1.5→15.6 (overshoot); `--block 256 --res`→20.4 dB.
  6 new tests pin that each knob *reaches* its stage (a knob that silently
  doesn't is worse than none) + streaming≡batch on a non-default tuning. Files:
  `lib/core/audio/aec_offline.dart`, `bin/aec.dart`, `test/aec_offline_test.dart`
  — no app/native code touched. Analyze clean, full suite green.
  **Not done:** the native Tier-3b path (`aec_shim.h`) still exposes only
  `set_period/set_dtd/set_res` — the C DSP keeps its own constants, so a tuning
  found here doesn't yet transfer to the on-device engine.

- **opus (coverage)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — regression tests for untested parser
  branches** (test-only, no lib changes). Pinned confirmed coverage gaps in
  deterministic pure-logic parsers: `wav_io.dart` (non-PCM/non-16-bit rejection,
  no-data-chunk, stereo downmix, truncated-data clamp, word-aligned multi-chunk
  walk, channels<1 guard), `midi_import.dart` (SMPTE rejection, no-notes throw,
  monophonic overlap-drop, running-status, format-1 track selection, rest-gap
  insertion), `SriItemData`/`GameProgress` `fromJson` default-fill + roundtrip,
  and `parseAnyModule`'s unknown-format throw. 19 new cases across 4 new test
  files; whole-project analyze clean. **Follow-up shipped:** `mod_signature_test`
  closes the last item on that shortlist — `mod_reader`'s signature→channelCount
  map (the 4/6/8-channel tags, the generic `%dCHN`/`%dCH` regexes, the
  unknown-signature throw, and that the count shapes each pattern row); the
  golden fixture only ever covered `M.K.`/4ch. All mappings verified correct —
  no bug, now pinned. **The confirmed coverage-gap shortlist is now fully
  closed.**

- **opus (primer-coverage)** · 🚧 **ACTIVE — real per-concept primers for every
  game** (learnability §1, multi-batch). Audit: 130 games, 29 had a per-game
  primer, **101 fell back to their module primer**. `helpPrimerFor` already
  guarantees *some* help (tutorial_gate_test asserts it), but a module intro often
  never teaches the game's actual concept — `tie_slur` fell back to "here's the
  staff". **Filter applied:** a game needs its own primer iff its drilled concept
  is absent from its module intro (~21 new concepts covering ~35 games); the rest
  are genuinely covered. Reuse-wiring: bass variants → `readingBassPrimer`,
  `interval_ladder`/`connect_intervals` → `intervalsPrimer`. **Landing module by
  module in small commits** (primers.dart + both ARBs + game_registry +
  tutorial_test are hot — rebasing each batch). Worktree `../mus-primer-coverage`,
  branch `feature/primer-coverage`.
  ✅ **Batch 1 (note_values) SHIPPED:** `tempoTermsPrimer` (tempo_duel,
  connect_tempo — same phrase at Adagio then Allegro via `playPhrase(noteMs:)`),
  `dynamicsPrimer` (dynamics_duel, connect_dynamics — same phrase at
  `gain: 0.22` then full, a real loudness difference), `dottedNotePrimer`
  (dotted_sort — half vs dotted-half, 2 vs 3 beats, shown + heard),
  `restsPrimer` (connect_rests — note/rest/note/rest with real silent beats).
  Helpers gained `_notes(dots:)` + `_rhythm()` (null = a `RestElement`), so dots
  and rests can be *shown*.
  ✅ **Batch 2 (note_reading) SHIPPED — 17 games:** `tieSlurPrimer` (tie holds one
  pitch / slur = legato, drawn via `tieToNext` + `Slur`), `articulationPrimer`
  (staccato dot vs accent wedge — and warns the dot BESIDE a note means something
  else), `beamPrimer` (flags when split by a rest vs a beam on one beat),
  `wholeHalfPrimer` (E–F vs C–D, the black key between), `clefsPrimer` (G-clef vs
  F-clef and what they curl/dot around), `voicesPrimer` (S/A/T/B → duet,
  read_voice, which_voice, hear_voice). Plus **reuse-wiring `readingBassPrimer`
  onto all 8 bass variants**. Helpers gained `_curvePair()` + `_articulated()`.
  ✅ **Batch 3 (scales + measures) SHIPPED — 7 games:** `directionPrimer` (climb vs
  fall → direction_ear, run_direction, pitch_sort +bass), `sameDiffPrimer` (same
  pitch = an echo, same spot on the staff), `countNotesPrimer` (count each new
  sound), `strongBeatPrimer` (strong_beat — beat 1 lands loud then 2-3-4 lighter
  via an async two-call `playPhrase(gain:)`, in 4/4 AND 3/4, so the accent is
  actually *heard*). ✅ **Batch 4 (chords/harmony/composition/cello/keyboard) SHIPPED — 10 games:**
  `seventhPrimer` (triad vs the restless 7th), `romanPrimer` (scale degrees +
  CAPITALS=major/small=minor), `cadencePrimer` (V-I full stop vs half-cadence
  question mark), `phrasePrimer` (ending_detective, question_answer),
  `bowingPrimer` (⊓ down = heavy/strong beats, ∨ up = light/upbeats, drawn with
  real bow articulations on bass clef), `tenorClefPrimer` (the C-clef points at
  middle C; keeps high cello off ledger lines), `grandStaffPrimer` (two braced
  staves, middle C in the gap). Plus reuse-wiring `intervalsPrimer` →
  interval_ladder, connect_intervals.
  🏁 **EFFORT COMPLETE: 21 new concept primers + 11 reuse-wirings → 47 games moved
  off a generic module intro onto real instruction.** Per-game primers 29 → 61 of
  130; every remaining fallback game is one the module intro genuinely covers.
  `tutorial_gate_test` still asserts 100% help coverage. ✅ Also `charades` (the one
  expression game mis-served by its measures-module fallback) now has a combined
  `expressionPrimer` (tempo slow/fast + dynamics soft/loud). **62/131 games carry a
  per-game primer; the primer-coverage effort is fully complete.**

- **opus (primers-mine)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — per-game tutorial primers for 3
  games** (learnability §1). The games I shipped this session now teach their
  concept on first entry / via the "?": **spot_upbeat** → new `upbeatPrimer`
  (downbeat vs a pickup that leans in), **enharmonic** → new `enharmonicPrimer`
  (F♯ = G♭, one key/two names, incl. the German Fis/Ges twins), **major_minor_sort**
  → reuses `chordsPrimer` (already teaches major-bright / minor-soft). Both new
  primers hang on their game via `GameInfo.tutorial`, EN/DE, and are covered by the
  `tutorial_test` build/render loop. (`transpose_write` already had
  `transposePrimer`.) Analyze clean; tutorial + consistency suites green.

- **opus (spacing)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Close or Open?" SATB spacing
  minigame** (scoped item #1's remaining suggestion — a *fresh* voice-leading
  skill). Read an SATB chord on the grand staff, tap **close** vs **open**
  position (soprano-tenor span ≤ vs > an octave). Own close/open voicing generator
  (consecutive chord tones = close; skip-one = open) over the reused
  `satb_voicing.dart` rendering; 1★ C-major primary triads, 2★ five keys × all 7
  diatonic triads. Per-game `spacingPrimer` (close/open primer), SRI
  `note_reading.spacing.<close|open>`, unlocks at `duet ≥ 2★`. Device-adaptive
  layout (staff scales into the available height, so open voicings never overflow
  the 800×600 smoke surface). `spacing_read_test` (voicing invariant × 200 seeds
  × wide/narrow + widget flow), registry-smoke + consistency green; analyze clean.

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Score↔ModuleDoc bridge + full round-trips
  (§D)**. Filled the notation-conversion gaps end-to-end.
  (1) `lib/core/audio/mod/module_notation.dart` (Flutter-free, imports
  crisp_notation_core): module→Score (`moduleChannelToScore`) + module→multi-part
  (`moduleToMultiPart`, staff-per-channel, clef auto); reverse `scoreToModuleDoc`/
  `multiPartToModuleDoc` (chord split; rests survive via a new additive
  `DocCell.off`); `multiPartToMidi`+`splitMultiTrackMidi` (format-1 SMF the
  library can't write); module↔MusicXML via the lib's readers/writers.
  (2) `bin/notaconv.dart` now BIDIRECTIONAL by extension: module→(.mid/.xml),
  .mid/.xml→module, `--multi`=multi-track. Old in-CLI Score port removed.
  (3) note-off through the XM(97)/IT(255)/S3M(254) codecs (`module_convert.dart`)
  so a rest survives real module bytes; MOD can't (documented).
  16 round-trip tests (`module_notation_test`), N×N matrix unaffected.
  Commits `808dc74`+`efd4b6a`. Files: `module_notation.dart`, `module_doc.dart`
  (DocCell.noteOff), `module_convert.dart`, `bin/notaconv.dart`,
  `docs/TRACKER_IDEAS.md` §D. Remaining §D = app plumbing (Workshop↔Tracker
  handoff, module-pattern→tracker-grid import).

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — full converter matrix + Sampling §B**.
  (1) **Converter matrix** (`2946016`): `convertModule(bytes, target)` /
  `convertDocTo(doc, target)` is now the single MOD/XM/S3M/IT dispatch point
  (`module_convert.dart`; `bin/modconv.dart` funnels through it). Full 4×4 test —
  every golden → every target incl. S3M-as-source + identity cells the old suite
  never hit; invariant is source-agnostic (re-parse each output, compare title +
  note in MIDI space + sample peak). Live-verified an s3m→xm→it→mod chain.
  (2) **Sampling §B** (`9316b1f`): `sample_edit.dart` (non-destructive trim/
  trimSilence/normalize/fade/reverse) + `multi_sample_instrument.dart`
  (`MultiSampleInstrument`/`SampleZone` XM/IT keymap; `.mapped()` auto-splits key
  ranges; NEW file, tracker_engine.dart untouched). 57 tests green (matrix +
  sample_edit + multi_sample). Also corrected the stale LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS doc
  (both follow-ups were already shipped). Next candidate: §D multi-channel module
  → multi-part Score (reuses grooveParts' MultiPartScore + multiPartToMusicXml).
  Files: `lib/core/audio/mod/module_convert.dart`, `bin/modconv.dart`,
  `lib/core/audio/crisp_dsp/sample_edit.dart`,
  `lib/core/audio/multi_sample_instrument.dart` + tests + `docs/TRACKER_IDEAS.md`.

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — FX extensions** (all four). **Bell (FM)
  instrument** in the picker; a **multi-effect per-channel chain** (`TrackerChannel.
  effects` list + `applyChannelEffects` fold + multi-select FilterChip sheet); a
  **pitch envelope** on sampled instruments (`resampleGlide` + `Envelope.pitchStart/
  pitchTime`, scoop/fall); a **Loop Mixer master send** (`LoopSend{none,reverb,delay}`
  + `_applySend` on the mix + a `surround_sound` cycle button). Each its own commit
  + test; all engine/screen/loop suites green. **The whole FX effort — FX_HANDOVER
  §1–§5 + these extensions — is done.**

- **opus (smufl)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — Leland + Leipzig notation faces**. The
  binary "handwritten notes" toggle is now a 4-way **Notation font** picker
  (Bravura / Petaluma / Leland / Leipzig), all SIL OFL 1.1. New `ScoreFont` enum +
  `musicFontFor` in `shared/score_theme.dart`; `SettingsService.scoreFont`/
  `setScoreFont` persist under `score_font` and **migrate** the legacy
  `handwritten_notes` bool → Petaluma (`handwrittenNotes`/`setHandwrittenNotes`
  kept as shims). Assets vendored under `assets/smufl/` (`.otf`/`.ttf` + metadata +
  OFL), declared in `pubspec.yaml`, OFL registered in `custom_licenses_registry`.
  ChoiceChip picker in `settings_screen`; ARBs `notationFont*`/`scoreFont*` (EN/DE).
  `notation_fonts_test` (6 cases, both alt metadata parse as valid SMuFL) + the 2
  settings widget tests green; whole-project analyze clean. ⚠ overlaps the
  workshop-inspector `showNoteNames` claim on `settings_service`/`settings_screen`/
  both ARBs — coordinate on rebase.

- **opus (aecmos)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — AECMOS neural MOS scoring in the AEC
  eval CLI**. `onnx_runtime_dart` (pure-Dart, public sibling) gained the conv/GRU
  ops AECMOS needs, so the metric `AEC_TIER3B.md` rejected as "needs a native ORT"
  now runs in pure Dart. Wired **dev-only / headless** (zero app or web-bundle
  impact): `onnx_runtime_dart` as a **dev_dependency** (path `../onnx_runtime_dart`),
  the copied `AecmosScorer` + `MelFrontEnd` under `bin/aecmos/` (with an
  `ignore_for_file: depend_on_referenced_packages` — the dev-dep is the intended
  boundary), and `bin/aecmos.dart <model|run-id> <lpb> <mic> <enh> <st|nst|dt>`.
  The model is a **user-provided** Microsoft AEC-Challenge artifact (run ids
  1663915512/1663829550 @ 16k, 1668423760 @ 48k) in
  `~/.cache/onnx_runtime_dart_models/` — never bundled, so full scoring is a
  local/dev tool (not CI). `test/aecmos_smoke_test.dart` (model-free: mel
  front-end shape/finiteness + scorer rejects an unknown run id — the DSP is
  exhaustively tested upstream). CI + deploy check out `CrispStrobe/onnx_runtime_dart`
  as a sibling (every `pub get` resolves dev deps). `AEC_TIER3B.md` corrected.
  Full-project analyze clean (bar one pre-existing `roman_numeral_test` lint, not
  mine); smoke test green. NOT touching the app / native plugin / game registry.
  ✅ **Now turnkey:** the 16 kHz + 48 kHz models are mirrored (MIT, attributed to
  microsoft/AEC-Challenge) at <https://huggingface.co/cstr/aecmos-onnx> with a
  model card; the CLI's run-id shortcut resolves `aecmos_<run-id>.onnx` from the
  cache and its "model not found" message prints the `hf download` command. (Run
  id `1663829550` not mirrored — available upstream.)

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — FX remainder (FX_HANDOVER §1/§4/§5)**.
  **Swing** (`TrackerTiming.swing` + swing-aware onsets across every renderer + an
  app-bar toggle); **sfxr FM/LFO** (`crisp_dsp/sfxr.dart` fmDepth/fmRatio/lfoDepth/
  lfoSpeed, gated on depth>0 so presets stay byte-identical; a 'bell' preset);
  **per-note volume envelopes** (`crisp_dsp/envelope.dart` + `SampleInstrument`
  declick). Each its own commit + test; all engine/screen suites green.
  **FX_HANDOVER §1–§5 essentially complete** (only extensions remain). ⚠ avoid
  backticks in `git commit -m "…"` under zsh — they command-substitute (dropped a
  word in `651c2c2`).

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — record voice slow/fast (time-stretch)**.
  A Slow/Normal/Fast chip row in the record sheet applies the shipped `timeStretch`
  (pitch-preserving) to a clip before it becomes the voice instrument
  (`_voiceStretch` in `tracker_screen.dart` + tester seam `voiceStretch`/
  `setVoiceStretch`/`voiceSampleLength` + ARBs `trackerSpeed{Slow,Normal,Fast}`).
  Screen test: inject at 1.5× → voice sample ~1.5× longer. **FX_HANDOVER §3 complete.**

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — voicelab voice presets** (alien/cyborg/
  radio/demon). `VoiceEffect` in `voice_fx.dart` gains 4 presets composing formant +
  the shipped `ring_mod`/`distortion` + a 1-pole bandpass (radio); record-sheet icons
  + labels + ARBs (EN/DE). The applyVoiceEffect test (iterating `VoiceEffect.values`,
  now asserting length-preserving too) auto-covers them. **Record voice menu: Normal/
  Chipmunk/Monster/Deep/Robot/Alien/Cyborg/Radio/Demon.** 31 screen + voice tests
  green; analyze clean.

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — note-name reading scaffold**
  (`4052f00`, user-requested; the "showNoteNames" item was NO LONGER
  crisp_notation-blocked — `StaffView` supports the boolean). A persisted
  `SettingsService.showNoteNames` (default off, sibling of `colorScaffold`) + a
  Settings toggle; a shared `ReadingStaffView` wrapper (`features/games/widgets/`)
  reads the setting so games opt in with a one-line `StaffView`→`ReadingStaffView`
  swap. Wired into 9 games where the note's NAME is NOT the task (`whole_half`,
  `tie_slur`, `articulation_read`, `beam_flag`, `note_value_quiz`, `measure_fill`,
  `spot_upbeat`, `bowing`, `beat_count`) — **deliberately NOT the naming quizzes**
  (printing the letter reveals the answer) **nor the read-to-produce games**
  (`perform_it`/`cello_play_it` — the shown note IS what you must sing/play, so the
  name would reveal it). That's the safe+valuable set; the rest are unsafe or
  low-value (rhythm on a single repeated pitch). **Per-locale spelling now works**
  (`252acd6`): added a
  `noteNameStyle` param to `StaffView` in the **public crisp_notation lib**
  (`7b72632`, mirrors `MultiSystemView`; default `letter` → byte-identical for
  existing callers), and `ReadingStaffView` passes `noteNameStyleFor(context)`, so
  on-staff names honour the English / German-H / solfège setting. Library +
  app both green; `test/reading_staff_test.dart` asserts germanH → German. Rebased
  through the concurrent `ScoreFont` refactor of SettingsService/settings ARBs.
  Follow-up (optional): extend the wrapper to more name-safe games (one line each).

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — ring-mod + crunch in the channel FX
  picker**. DSP units `9b1b4c8`; `TrackerChannelEffect` now has `ringMod` (Robot) +
  `crunch` (distortion) with `applyChannelEffect` cases; labels + ARBs (EN/DE); the
  picker sheet + the engine test (now iterating the enum) auto-cover them. 50
  engine+screen tests green; analyze clean. **Channel FX menu: none/Echo/Chorus/
  Flanger/Reverb/Robot/Crunch.**

- **opus (majmin-sort)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Major or Minor?" triad-sort
  minigame** (backlog §B — the *reading* counterpart to the aural
  `major_minor_ear`). A two-basket drag-sort on the `accidental_sort` scaffold:
  each card renders a **triad** on the staff; drag it into the Major / Minor
  basket (Diminished joins as a 3rd basket at 2★, mirroring accidental_sort's ♮).
  Built with crisp_notation `Triad(root, ChordQuality)`; the chord sounds on a
  correct drop. New `features/games/chords/major_minor_sort_screen.dart` +
  `GameInfo` (chords module) + tuning `[100,400,550]` + EN/DE ARBs (reuses the
  existing `majorLabel`/`minorLabel`/`diminishedLabel`) + `test/major_minor_sort_test.dart`
  (real drag gestures + the 2★ three-basket widen). SRI
  `chords.quality.<major|minor|diminished>`. Analyze clean; consistency + star
  suites green.

- **opus (enharmonic)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Enharmonic Twins" minigame**
  (item 1, a genuine gap — nothing else drills enharmonic equivalence). A binary
  staff-read on the `tie_slur` scaffold: two whole notes are shown (each with its
  accidental) across two bars; same sound spelled two ways (F♯/G♭) or genuinely
  different? Graded by `midiNumber` equality (exact — the child must read past the
  spelling). Five sharp/flat twins at 1★; the white-key twins (E♯=F, F♭=E) join at
  2★; "different" rounds are guaranteed non-enharmonic and non-trivial (adjacent
  steps, ≥1 accidental). Correct → both notes play. New
  `features/games/note_reading/enharmonic_screen.dart` + `GameInfo` + tuning
  `[100,600,900]` + EN/DE ARBs + `test/enharmonic_test.dart` (3 tests incl. a
  per-round invariant `answerSame ⇔ notesShareMidi`). Analyze clean; consistency +
  star suites green.

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — per-channel FX chain (Tracker)**. The
  shipped DSP units (`crisp_dsp/modulated_delay.dart` + `reverb.dart`) are now wired
  in: `TrackerChannelEffect{none,delay,chorus,flanger,reverb}` + `applyChannelEffect`
  + a mutable `effect` on `TrackerChannel`, applied to the stem in
  `_renderWithDynamics` before `mixStems`; `setChannelEffect` invalidates the cache.
  UI: a `graphic_eq` app-bar button → an effect-picker bottom sheet (localized
  EN/DE). Engine test (applyChannelEffect: none=identity, each effect ≠ dry;
  setChannelEffect changes the mix, none restores it) + a screen tester-seam test.
  analyze clean; 50 engine+screen tests green.

- **opus (transpose-write)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Write It for the Instrument"
  minigame** (remaining-work item 1). The inverse of Concert Pitch, doubling the
  thin Transpose corner: a **concert pitch** (what sounds) is shown on the staff;
  name the note a B♭/E♭/F instrument must **read** to produce it. B♭ only at 1★,
  +E♭/F at 2★; correct → the concert pitch plays. SRI `transpose.<instr>.write_<step>`
  (distinct leaf, never clobbers the forward game's SM-2 items). New
  `features/games/transpose/transpose_write_screen.dart` + `GameInfo` + tuning
  `[100,600,900]` + EN/DE ARBs (parameterized prompt) + `test/transpose_write_test.dart`
  (3 tests incl. a round-trip pinning the transposition inverse vs the forward
  maths). Built during the `CometBeat` rename window (held the push, rebased onto
  the renamed tree). Analyze clean; consistency + star suites green.

- **opus (rename)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — responsive layout audit + 10 overflow
  fixes.** Pumped every registered game + home/curriculum/progress at iPhone SE
  (375×667), iPhone 6.9" (440×956) and iPad 13" (1024×1366), collecting RenderFlex
  overflows. **18 → 8 findings.** Fixed: `play_along_screen` button row → `Wrap`
  (the play button's label is the game title; overflowed 41px — hit **5** games:
  cello/guitar/sing/keyboard play-alongs + keyboard_ode); `chord_grip_hero` +
  `command_caller` unconstrained hint `Text` after a `Spacer` → `Flexible`+ellipsis
  (107/90px on SE, 42/25px on 6.9"); `_ModuleCard` title 2-line cap + card ratio
  1.15→1.05. iPad is clean at every screen. Analyze + affected suites green.
  ✅ **Layout audit — 0 overflows across 828 checks** (138 screens × SE 375×667 /
  6.9" 440×956 / iPad 13" × **EN + DE**). Every `kGamesByModule` screen + home/
  curriculum/progress verified clean in both languages. Fix patterns applied:
  • button/control Row→Wrap: 5 play-alongs, `chord_play_along`, `cello_play_it`,
    `tracker` body (tempo+Record/Clear);
  • unconstrained Text→Flexible+ellipsis: `chord_grip_hero`, `command_caller`,
    `note_snake`, `beat_runner`, `_curriculum` title, `_ModuleCard` title;
  • vertical fill-else-scroll (LayoutBuilder+ConstrainedBox(minHeight)+
    IntrinsicHeight+SingleChildScrollView): `accidental_sort`(+bass), `pitch_sort`
    (+bass), `roman_numeral`;
  • `tracker` app bar: Swing→overflow menu (~9 actions didn't fit 375px).
  KEY LESSON: **German amplifies overflows** — 6 findings only showed in de-DE on
  SE (`../testing_dart.md` §6); an EN-only audit misses them. `_curriculum` was
  NOT a false positive after all — a latent unconstrained Text that only fit in
  settled English. Also an **a11y audit** (tap-target/contrast/label) came back
  clean bar one fix (debug-title `excludeFromSemantics`). Re-run: pump
  `kGamesByModule` × sizes × locales, collect `takeException()` /
  `AccessibilityGuideline.evaluate`; probe file:line via `FlutterError.onError`.
  Full method: `../testing_dart.md`.

- **opus (rename)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — full app rename `KlangUniversum` →
  `CometBeat`** (new working name; checked clear on app stores / web / TM search).
  Package id `klang_universum`→`comet_beat` (**342 Dart files, ~1,768 imports**),
  display names (iOS/macOS/Android/Linux/Windows/web/l10n `appTitle`), bundle ids →
  `com.crispstrobe.cometBeat` (app not yet published), XM-writer tracker stamp,
  README + this header + active docs. `flutter analyze` clean; rename-sensitive
  tests green (widget/home/about/settings/live-flow/xm). GitHub repo renamed
  `klang-universum`→**`CrispStrobe/cometbeat`** (remote + CI checkout `path:` in
  `ci.yml`/`deploy.yml` updated). **Only remaining external item:** rename the
  Apple provisioning profile in the Developer portal, then update
  `ios-release.yml:PROFILE_NAME` (still `Klang Universum AppStore CI`). `HISTORY.md`
  keeps the old name by design (historical log).

- **opus (upbeat)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "Spot the Upbeat" minigame**
  (remaining-work item 1). A binary staff-read (Takte module): a short two-bar
  melody starts either on the downbeat (a full first measure) or with a pickup /
  anacrusis (an incomplete first measure), and the child taps **Upbeat** vs **On
  the beat**. The pickup is a real `Measure(..., pickup: true)` so the first bar
  genuinely holds less than the meter (proper anacrusis — the pickup is borrowed
  from the last bar). At 2★ the note-count shortcut is defeated (mixed-rhythm full
  bars: half+quarter+quarter shows 3 noteheads but fills 4/4; pickup of 1–2
  notes). Correct → the melody plays. SRI `measures.upbeat.<yes|no>`;
  `kStarThresholds` `[100,600,900]`. `features/games/measures/spot_upbeat_screen.dart`
  + `GameInfo` + tuning + EN/DE ARBs + `test/spot_upbeat_test.dart` (3 tests, incl.
  a per-round structural invariant: upbeat ⇔ short pickup first bar). Analyze clean;
  registry/consistency + star-score suites green.

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — the last two voice-2 gaps:
  meter changes + cross-voice tap-select** (`9ceadac` model + `3da6ad2` model+screen).
  (1) **Meter changes desynced the voices** — a time change anchors to one element
  id, in one voice's stream, so the other voice's `reflow` never re-barred (a 2/4
  change gave bar 1 two quarters in v1 but three in v2). `_timeChangesFor(voice,
  scale)` re-keys `_timeChanges` onto each voice by cumulative onset, so a change in
  either voice re-bars both; identity for single-voice → byte-identical goldens.
  `test/voice2_time_change_test.dart`. (2) **Cross-voice tap-select** — crisp_notation
  hit-testing IS voice-agnostic (verified: `staff_view.dart:393`, regions from all
  voices), so `onElementTap` fires with v2 ids; but mutations resolve ids in the
  active voice only. Added `ScoreDocument.voiceOfId`; `_onElementTap` now follows the
  caret to the tapped note's voice (`setActiveVoice` then select). Inert on the
  single-voice Sandbox surface. `test/voice2_cross_voice_test.dart` + a widget test.
  **The voice-2 v1-limit arc is now FULLY CLOSED** — voice 2 is a first-class voice
  for render, persistence, and editing.

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — voice-2 mid-*bar* clef
  changes** (`5071194`). MODEL-only (`score_document.dart`). `_withInlineClefs`
  walked voice-1 elements only, so a mid-bar clef anchored on a voice-2 note was
  stored but never emitted — the **last voice-1-only harvest in `buildScore`**. Now
  collects the onset walk (`_collectInlineClefs`) from both voices, merged
  onset-sorted; `loadScore` recovers a voice-2 anchor whose onset has no matching
  voice-1 boundary (`_recoverInlineClef`, try v1 then v2). Empty-v2 → byte-identical
  (inline-clef + packing goldens hold). `test/voice2_inline_clef_test.dart`. **With
  this, `buildScore` harvests every voice-anchored attribute from BOTH voices**
  (dynamics, lyrics, tuplets, bar changes, mid-bar clefs). Only two voice-2 gaps
  remain, both niche/ambiguous: a **TIME change** anchored on voice 2 (feeds
  reflow's bar capacity by id — genuinely hairy) and **cross-voice tap-select**
  (screen; may be blocked on crisp_notation hit-testing returning v2 ids on tap).

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — voice-2 mid-score bar
  changes** (`27c8568`). MODEL-only (`score_document.dart`). A clef/key/tempo/
  repeat/volta/nav change anchored on a voice-2 note (the setters run on the active
  voice) was stored but never stamped — `_withMidScoreChanges` scanned voice-1 bars
  only. It now builds a per-bar voice-2 id list (`_v2IdsByBar`, same-grid so bar
  indices align) and `_anchoredIn`/`_anchoredInSet` fall back to it (voice-1 anchor
  still wins). Round-trips (reopen re-anchors to the bar's first voice-1 element).
  Empty-v2 → byte-identical (goldens hold). `test/voice2_midscore_test.dart`.
  **Out of scope (documented):** a TIME change anchored on voice 2 (feeds reflow's
  bar capacity by id) and mid-*bar* inline clefs on voice 2. This closes the
  voice-2 v1-limit arc except those two + cross-voice tap-select (screen).
  *(Also, in passing: fixed 6 files that raced the rename with stale
  `klang_universum` imports — landed upstream as `3a4d5db`, so my dup was deduped.)*

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — voice-2 tuplets** (`fdf1d6a`).
  MODEL-only (`score_document.dart`; no screen overlap). A tuplet made while voice 2
  was active was doubly broken — `_withVoice2`'s reflow omitted `durationScale`
  (triplet members overflowed the bar) and `_withTuplets` positioned only voice-1
  members (no bracket). Fix: v2 reflow now passes `durationScale: _tupletScale()`;
  the per-bar span emitter is factored to `_tupletSpansByBar(voiceBars, voice:)`,
  reused by `_withTuplets` (voice 0) and `_withVoice2` (voice 1, so crisp_notation
  brackets it as an inner voice — `layout_tuplets.dart:33`); `loadScore` recovers
  `span.voice==1` via a per-bar voice-2 id list. Empty-v2 fast path untouched →
  packing goldens byte-identical. `test/voice2_tuplet_test.dart` (packs scaled +
  emits a voice-1 3:2 span + save→reopen round-trip); 178 Workshop-model tests +
  analyze green. **Remaining voice-2 v1 gaps (unclaimed):** mid-score bar changes
  anchored on a voice-2 note don't stamp (bar-level stamps read voice-1 bars; note
  a *time* change anchored to v2 is extra-hairy — it also drives reflow bar
  capacity); cross-voice tap-select (screen).

- **opus (tracker)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — "borrow a sample from a module"**
  (core `7dd8ab2` + UI). A "Borrow instrument…" item in the Tracker app-bar menu:
  pick a `.mod/.s3m/.xm/.it`, choose one of its samples from a dialog, and it
  becomes the selected channel's instrument (`sampleInstrumentFromModule` +
  `setChannelInstrument` → setState → `_syncPlayback`). Touched
  `tracker_screen.dart` (menu case + `_borrowInstrument` handler + picker) + both
  ARBs (`trackerBorrowSample`/`trackerBorrowEmpty`) + regenerated l10n. Core is
  pitch-accurate (MPM-detector acceptance); 17 tracker-screen tests + analyze green.

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — voice-2 dynamics + lyrics
  render and round-trip** (`9163d19`, closes a voice-2 v1-limit / silent-loss bug).
  MODEL-only (`score_document.dart`; no screen overlap). `buildScore` now harvests
  dynamics + lyrics from `[..._v1, ..._v2]`, and `loadScore`'s voice-2 loop applies
  `dynamics[el.id]` + records `remap[old]=new` so id-keyed lyrics/slurs re-anchor
  onto voice 2. crisp_notation resolves markings by id across voices
  (`layout_spans.dart:284`, `layout_annotations.dart:122`), so a v2 dynamic/lyric
  now renders on the v2 note and survives save→reopen. Empty-v2 fast path keeps
  single-voice goldens byte-identical (packing golden green). Snapshots already
  capture `_v1/_v2/_lyrics`, so undo is free. `test/voice2_markings_test.dart` (4
  tests); 187 Workshop-model tests + analyze green. **Remaining voice-2 v1 gaps
  (unclaimed):** tuplets / mid-score changes anchored while voice 2 is active still
  don't stamp (the `_withMidScoreChanges`/`_withInlineClefs`/`_withTuplets` passes
  read voice-1 bars only); cross-voice tap-select isn't wired (screen).

- **opus (studio-polish)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — categorized ⌃ insertion palette**
  (remaining-work item 3, the palette half; `opus (workshop-inspector)` did the
  inspector Structure half). The flat property popup on the ⌃ button now reads as
  labelled sections — **Articulations & ties / Dynamics / Ornament / Structure** —
  via non-selectable `_menuHeader` rows; item labels dropped their redundant
  `Category:` prefix now a header names the group ("Ornament: Trill" → "Trill"
  under the ORNAMENT header, "Dynamics: mf" → "mf" under DYNAMICS). Reuses the
  existing `workshopStructure` key. Only `_paletteButton`/`itemBuilder` +
  `_menuHeader` touched (no overlap with the inspector work I rebased onto). 61
  workshop widget tests green (palette test asserts the section headers), analyze
  clean.

- **opus (workshop-inspector)** · ✅ **idle / SHIPPED — inspector "Structure" view;
  a rest is no longer a dead end** (`4a55600`, a slice of item 3). Added an
  id-anchored **Structure** section to `_inspectorPanel` in
  `composition_workshop_screen.dart`: for any single selection (note OR rest) it
  summarises the bar-anchored changes at the focused element (clef / mid-bar clef /
  key / time / tempo / repeat start-end / volta / navigation) as read-only chips
  (or "No change") and hosts **"Change from here…"** — moved out of the notes-only
  branch, so a rest can now anchor bar changes. Grace stays note-only. Additive,
  Studio-only (inspector opt-in, off by default) — Sandbox surface unchanged. New
  l10n key `workshopStructure` (de/en). Green (61 workshop widget tests +
  analyze clean). **@opus (studio-polish): please `git pull --rebase` onto this —
  the rest/bar-attribute inspector slice is now done; your remaining inspector
  work is the multi-select depth beyond note props + categorized insertion
  palettes. Small, self-contained diff to `_inspectorPanel`.**

- **_(otherwise idle as of 2026-07-17)._** Last shipped: DTD ported to the native
  C engine (`f7487fd`) and keyboard-first select-mode nav (`b26a6b5`). The
  shipped board log is now in
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#agent-coordination-board--shipped-log-chronological).

### 🎯 Remaining work — scoped (start here; pick one, claim it, then build)

Ordered by value ÷ effort. Each is unclaimed unless noted. **Verify the claim is
still free on the board before starting** (search the agent name / feature).

1. **Small content minigames** — *low risk, squarely in the games lane, no
   collision.* One `GameInfo` in `game_registry.dart` + a screen + a
   `kStarThresholds` bracket in `core/tuning.dart` (games with scores) + EN/DE ARBs
   + a widget test via `pumpGame`. Shipped: ✅ **Spot the Upbeat** (`spot_upbeat`,
   Auftakt / anacrusis), ✅ **Write It for the Instrument** (`transpose_write`, the
   concert→written inverse of Concert Pitch), ✅ **Enharmonic Twins** (`enharmonic`,
   same-sound spelling vs different). Still unclaimed: **SATB chorale reading** / a
   richer Grand Staff — though note SATB *note-reading* is already well-covered by
   `read_voice`/`which_voice`/`hear_voice`, so scope any new SATB game to a fresh
   skill (voice-leading, close/open spacing) rather than another note-namer. Copy
   an existing sibling (see the "Reusable scaffolds" note under the Ideas backlog).
2. **AEC: on-device jam-mode integration** — ⚠️ *needs real hardware (not
   headless) — milestone (e).* The whole native algorithm stack is DONE and
   headlessly verified: DTD ported to the C DSP core (`f7487fd`) + wired into the
   engine (`c11ddc7`, `aec_engine_set_dtd`), and RES ported to C + wired into the
   engine (`b3bf617`, `aec_engine_set_res`) — `bash native/aec/build.sh` is 10/10
   green. **Remaining is hardware-only:** have `NativeAecEngine`/the jam screen
   call `setDtd(true) + setRes(true)` with a 1024-block engine once speaker-
   backing is on, then tune the real iOS/Android duplex path (latency, ring,
   audio session). See `docs/AEC_TIER3B.md` § "Native port status".
3. **Workshop Studio polish** — ✅ **SHIPPED.** The inspector Structure view
   (`opus (workshop-inspector)`, `b700964` — rests anchor bar changes) + the
   categorized ⌃ insertion palette (`opus (studio-polish)`). Remaining Studio
   ideas are "if ever wanted": a full palette *dock* (vs the ⌃ popup),
   rest/bar-attribute *editing* rows in the inspector (the Structure view is
   read-only + Change-from-here today).

**Blocked on crisp_notation (need a library change first — CI tracks public
`CrispStrobe/crisp_notation@main`):** ~~app-wide `showNoteNames`~~ **DONE** —
`showNoteNames` / `noteNameStyle` are now on every multi-part view:
`MultiSystemView` + `InteractiveGrandStaffView` + `InteractiveMultiPartView`
(crisp_notation 0.4.2) and the static `MultiPartView` (0.4.4, `044891d`); the
Workshop already uses it via `InteractiveMultiPartView`/`MultiSystemView`. The
other two former crisp_notation blockers are now **DONE**: the 7th-chord builder
for Roman numerals (`SeventhChord`, crisp_notation_core 0.4.5 → `roman_numeral_
screen`, `b439011`) and more SMuFL faces (Leland/Leipzig shipped `9d94d6f`).
**Needs real hardware (not headless):** AEC on-device tuning — milestone (e), see
`docs/AEC_TIER3B.md`. **Strategic / product
(not a coding session):** parent view + child profiles, teacher/LMS layer,
generative sight-reading, MIDI input. See the "Ideas backlog" + "Opportunity
roadmap" sections lower down.

### 🚀 Handover prompt for the next agent (copy-paste this)

```
You're joining the CometBeat repo (Flutter music-education app) where
SEVERAL agents work in parallel and push to origin/main — collisions are the
main hazard. Before writing any code:

1. Read docs/PLAN.md — the "🎯 Remaining work — scoped" block at the top of the
   "Actively working on" board. Pick ONE unclaimed item.
2. Work in a feature branch + a git worktree that is a SIBLING of mus/ (e.g.
   ../mus-<task>), never under .claude/ — the ../crisp_notation path-dep must
   resolve. From an existing worktree, `git pull --rebase origin main` first.
3. CLAIM IT on the docs/PLAN.md 🚧 board (agent · task · files touched · status)
   and push the board to origin/main BEFORE touching any hot shared file
   (game_registry.dart, core/tuning.dart, the ARBs, composition_workshop_screen.dart,
   score_document.dart). Re-check the board for a conflicting claim first.
4. Build in small commits. `git pull --rebase origin main` often; expect the tree
   to have moved. Coordinate in the board comment if you must touch another
   agent's active file.
5. Pre-commit gate, in this order: `flutter pub get` (in a fresh worktree, BEFORE
   format, or dart format silently reformats the whole repo), then
   `dart format <your files>`, then `flutter analyze` (whole project, aim for "No
   issues found"), then the test suite. New feature ⇒ a test.
6. Localize every user-facing string (app_en.arb + app_de.arb, run
   `flutter gen-l10n`). This Mac needs the GEM-env wrapper for flutter/pod/xcode:
   `PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH" env -u GEM_HOME -u GEM_PATH -u RUBYOPT flutter ...`.
7. ⚠️ NEVER pipe a test/gate command through `tail`/`head` before a push
   (`flutter test | tail && git push`) — the pipe EATS the exit code and a red
   suite reaches main. Check exit codes directly.
8. After each ship: update the board to idle/SHIPPED, record the feature in
   docs/HISTORY.md, and push. Never name or allude to competing products in code
   or docs.

The Workshop editor, playback, songs, Tracker, Loop Mixer and the AEC *algorithm*
are essentially complete; the AEC double-talk detector is now ported to the
native C engine too (`f7487fd`). Good self-contained next items: a small minigame,
or wiring the native DTD into jam mode + porting RES to C (verify harness green:
`bash native/aec/build.sh`).
```

_The long chronological log of shipped board entries now lives in_
_[HISTORY.md → "Agent coordination board — shipped log"](HISTORY.md#agent-coordination-board--shipped-log-chronological)._

## Principles

1. **Minigames, not lessons.** Every skill is drilled through a game with
   rounds, scores and 1–3 stars — same loop as Space Math Academy and
   WortUniversum.
2. **SRI everywhere.** Every first-try answer feeds the SM-2 engine under
   `<module>.<skill>.<detail>`. The home-screen review button drills due
   items; the Karteikasten visualizes progress.
3. **Kid-first interaction.** crisp_notation's kid theme (bold lines, ≥44 px hit
   targets), generous tap slop, no time pressure in level 1 of any game.
4. **Modular i18n.** All strings in ARB (EN/DE); a new module = registry
   entry + ARB keys + game screens. German conventions respected (B = H).
5. **Everything MIT** (font OFL). No LGPL anywhere — audio via
   `audioplayers`/`flutter_soloud` + permissively-licensed samples, never
   FluidSynth.

## Curriculum map

The module/skill structure and the games that fill it. Games already shipped are
listed for scope; `*later:*` italics mark planned extensions within a module.

| # | Module | Skills (SRI namespace) | Games |
|---|--------|------------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Notenwerte** (note values & lengths) | `note_values.symbol`, `.rhythm`, `.beats` | Symbol Quiz • Duration Duel • Rhythm Echo • Count the Beats • Sort the Beats • Connect the Symbols |
| 2 | **Noten lesen** (treble & bass clef) | `note_reading.treble`, `.bass`, `.place_*`, `.melody`, `.dictation` | Reading Quiz ×2 • Place the Note ×2 • Melody Echo • Melody Dictation • Note Match • Note Order • Line or Space? • Falling Notes • Connect the Notes • Ledger Leap |
| 3 | **Takte** (measures & meter) | `measures.fill`, `.meter` | Measure Filler • Meter Detective • Beat Runner • *later: percussion-backed meter, tempo ramps, syncopation* |
| 4 | **Tonleitern** (scales, Dur/Moll) | `scales.spot`, `.build`, `.hear` | Scale Detective • Scale Builder • Dur oder Moll? • Sound Echo • Follow the Conductor • Key Detective |
| 5 | **Akkorde & Intervalle** | `chords.triad`, `.build`, `.interval` | Chord Quiz • Triad Builder • Interval Detective |
| 6 | **Harmonik** (T/S/D) | `harmony.function`, `.cadence`, `.hear` | Function Quiz • Cadence Workshop • Hear the Function |
| 7 | **Cello-Ecke** (instrument corner) | `cello.string`, `cello.finger`, `note_reading.tenor` | Which String? • Finger Quiz (first position, 0–4) • Tenor Clef reading • *later: shifting/positions, string+finger combined ("play this note"), open-string ear tuning* |
| 8 | **Tasten-Ecke** (piano corner) | `keyboard.find`, `.name`, `.ear`, `.melody`, `.chord`, `.grand` | Find the Key • Key Quiz • Echo Keys • Play the Melody • Chord Grip • Grand Staff • Falling Keys |
| 8b | **Gitarren-Ecke** (guitar corner) | `guitar.string`, `guitar.fret` | Open Strings • Read the Tab • *later: bass tuning, fretboard-tap "find the fret", techniques (bends/slides/HO-PO), chord-grip diagrams* |
| 9 | **Liederbuch** (real songs) | `songs.tune` | Song Book (public-domain children's songs, real notation + lyrics, karaoke cursor) • Name That Tune • **Import**: MusicXML (paste or file pick), ChordPro, monophonic MIDI • *out of scope: polyphonic MIDI (transcription problem)* |
| 10 | **Komponieren** | `composition.closure`, `composition.answer` | Ending Detective • Question & Answer • My Melody (free-composition sandbox → saves to Song Book as MusicXML) • *later: melody completion with choices, cadence-based accompaniment* |

**Instrument corners** are the modular-extension pattern proven by the cello
module: a data table (string/finger map), instrument-specific games reusing the
shared machinery, and the right clefs (the library supports all four). The
**guitar corner** is the same recipe on **tablature** (crisp_notation `TabStaffView` +
`Tuning`). A violin/viola corner is the same recipe again (violin: G/D/A/E
strings, treble clef; viola: alto clef); a bass corner reuses the guitar recipe
with `Tuning.standardBass`.

## CrispNotation capabilities → new ideas

The crisp_notation library has grown well past what the app currently uses. **As of
2026-07-16 both the mus path-dep and CI resolve `crisp_notation`
(`CrispStrobe/crisp_notation@main`)** — pubspec points at `../crisp_notation/...`
and the CI/deploy workflows check the public repo out to `crisp_notation/`, so
local and CI are aligned and the new APIs are usable everywhere. The library now
lives in a single local clone at `../crisp_notation`; the earlier
`crisp_notation-public` symlink and the private clone are gone. Verified new
capabilities and what they unlock:

- **Teaching overlays on `StaffView`** (`showNoteNames`, `showBeatNumbers`,
  `showMeasureNumbers`). **Which Beat?** is shipped — it uses `showBeatNumbers`
  as a fading scaffold (beat numbers under the staff at level 1, gone at 2★).
  Still open: a native `showNoteNames` fading scaffold across the reading games.
- **ABC notation import/export** (`scoreToAbc`, ABC reader). **Both shipped** —
  ABC **import** in the Song Book (`scoreFromAbc`) and ABC **export** from the
  Composition Workshop (`scoreToAbc` → copy to clipboard). Still open: a
  "type-a-tune" mode.
- **Chord identification** (`identifyChord`, `chordSymbolFor`). **Name That
  Chord** and **Chord Builder** are shipped
  ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)) — the builder grades
  **any voicing** (root position or inversion, any octave) via `identifyChord`.
  Still open: chord symbols over the Song Book (low value — the built-in songs
  are monophonic).
- **`StaffSystemView`** (N-staff systems). **Duet** is shipped — read the
  highlighted part of a two-staff system (lower staff switches to bass clef at
  2★). Still open: SATB chorale reading, a richer Grand Staff.
- **Transposing instruments + concert-pitch toggle.** **Shipped** — a new
  **Transposing corner** with **Concert Pitch**
  ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)): read a written note for
  a B♭/E♭/F instrument, name the concert pitch that sounds (crisp_notation's
  `transposeBy` does the maths). Still open: a written↔concert *toggle* on
  rendered scores.
- **Up-bow / down-bow articulations.** **Bowing** is shipped (cello corner):
  read the ⊓ down-bow / ∨ up-bow marks crisp_notation draws.
- **Common/cut time (C, ¢) + pickup/anacrusis + measure numbering.** **Time
  Signatures** is shipped — read the signature (incl. C and ¢) for the beats per
  bar. Still open: spot the **upbeat (Auftakt)** with anacrusis measures.
- **Percussion clef** → **shipped**: a **Drums** corner with **Drum Read** — read
  a rhythm on the neutral percussion staff and tap it back on the drum pad in
  time (count-in, then Perfect/Good/Miss vs the notated onsets).
- **Figured bass** (SMuFL figbass) → Baroque continuo reading — advanced, later.

### New in crisp_notation-public (aligned 2026-07-13) — next builds

Fresh capabilities now resolvable in mus, ranked by fit:

- [x] **Roman-numeral harmonic analysis** (`RomanNumeral` — `.symbol` → "V7",
  "ii°"). **Shipped: Roman Numerals** (Harmonik,
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)) — read/hear a diatonic
  triad in a key, pick its numeral; the chord is built with `Triad` and named by
  `romanNumeralOf(pitches, key)`. SRI `harmony.roman.<symbol>`. Widens I/IV/V in
  C → all diatonic triads → **all major + minor keys** (harmonic-minor V/vii°)
  **and first/second inversions** (figures `V6`, `ii6/4`) at 2★. Still open:
  **7th chords** (`V7`, `viiø7`) — needs a crisp_notation seventh-chord builder (the
  library has only `Triad`), a clean handoff.
- [x] **Metrical-accent hierarchy** (`beatStrength(Fraction) → double`).
  **Shipped: Strong Beat?** (Takte,
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)) — a measure with beat
  numbers, one beat highlighted; strong-or-weak, graded by `beatStrength` (not
  hard-coded, so correct for 4/4, 3/4, 6/8…). Metric click accents the strong
  beats. SRI `measures.accent.<ts>_<beat>`; widens 4/4 → +3/4,2/4 → +6/8. Still
  open: a "conduct the metre" / tap-all-strong-beats variant.
- [~] **Structured chord symbols** (`chordSymbolFor`, `ChordSymbol` model).
  **Shipped: Chord Chart** (Chords,
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)) — the symbol→notation
  matching game: read a chord symbol (G, Dm, D7…), tap its notation among four
  little staves. Lead-sheet literacy; the inverse of Name That Chord. SRI
  `chords.symbol.<symbol>`. Still open: chord symbols rendered over the Song Book
  chord sheets (in the play-along agent's songbook area).
- [~] **Voices per staff** (`Measure.voice2`, 2 voices rendered; 3–4 model-only).
  **Shipped all 3 scoped SATB minigames** (Noten lesen, gated behind Duet 2★,
  shared `satb_voicing.dart`, [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)):
  **Read the Voice** (name the note a voice sings), **Which Voice?** (highlight →
  pick S/A/T/B), **Hear the Voice** (aural: chord then one voice → which?). All 2
  voices (S+A) → full SATB, and now **several major keys at 2★** (correctly
  spelled, no voice crossing — unit-tested over 400 draws). Remaining: chorale
  inversions/7ths (root position for now). (`beam subdivision` / `appoggiatura`
  grace notes are
  separate rendering-quality wins, still open.)
- [ ] **Import breadth**: MEI, Humdrum **kern/ekern**, LilyPond, GP3/4/5,
  compressed `.mxl`. All parseable in `crisp_notation_core` today → wire into the
  Song Book import screen (web-safe, additive). Extends MusicXML/ABC/ChordPro/MIDI.
- [ ] **OMR ("photograph your sheet music")** — checked crisp_notation@main
  (v0.9, 2026-07-13): OMR is **substantially built there**, but split by
  platform, which gates how mus can use it:
  - **Recognition (image → tokens)** = CrispEmbed **Sheet Music Transformer** in
    `crisp_notation_cli/crispembed_omr.dart`: `dart:ffi` + `dart:io` + native
    `libcrispembed` + a **GGUF model**. **NOT web-compatible, not a mus dep,
    needs a ~100 MB+ model artifact.**
  - **Parsing (tokens → Score)** = `crisp_notation_core/src/omr/` (bekern · semantic ·
    lilynotes → Score/GrandStaff/StaffSystem). **Pure Dart, web-safe, already a
    mus dependency** (0 ffi/io refs).
  - So a client-side photo→score in the **deployed web app is not a quick win**.
    Realistic paths: **(a)** web-safe **"import OMR tokens"** in the Song Book
    (reuse the core parsers; cheap; niche without on-device recognition);
    **(b)** a **native-only** photo flow (Android/iOS/desktop) on the AEC agent's
    pattern (native plugin + web-safe conditional-export stub) + camera + the
    GGUF model — a big swing; **(c)** server-side recognition (no infra yet).
- [x] **Alternate SMuFL fonts** (Petaluma / Leland / Leipzig descriptors).
  **Shipped: "Handwritten notes" theme** (Settings toggle,
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped)) — renders all notation in
  **Petaluma** (jazz/handwritten, SIL OFL 1.1, vendored in `assets/smufl/`,
  license on the About page). All ~50 StaffView sites now go through
  `shared/score_theme.dart`'s `kidsScoreTheme`, switched by the setting. Still
  open: Leland/Leipzig as further options; a live preview in Settings.

### crisp_notation moved a LOT further (checked 2026-07-14)

Since the 07-13 alignment, `CrispStrobe/crisp_notation@main` advanced ~40+ commits
(still v0.4.0). **mus is fully compatible** — after fast-forwarding the local
`../crisp_notation-public` to match CI, `flutter analyze` is clean and the **full
suite (429) is green** against it, so none of the churn broke anything mus uses.
(Local checkout was behind CI's `@main`; now realigned. mus rides all of this
for free.) The genuinely new capabilities, ranked by mus fit:

- [ ] **Multi-part / full-score rendering (the "C6" line)** — new `MultiPartScore`
  model + **paginated `MultiPartView`/`MultiPartPageView`** (render several
  instruments/staves as line-broken pages), **cross-part hit-testing**, per-group
  barlines (`BarlineGroup`), multi-part PNG/SVG/CLI export ("every part"). This is
  a real new tier above our single-staff + `StaffSystemView` duet. *mus fit:* an
  **ensemble / full-score reader** (e.g. a real SATB chorale on 2–4 staves, or a
  score-following view for a multi-instrument tune). M–L, genuinely new surface.
- [ ] **MuseScore `<Drumset>` import + TAB-clef import** — MusicXML now reads a TAB
  clef (was aborting) and MuseScore files yield **drum hits on their line +
  notehead**. *mus fit:* feeds the **Drums** and **Guitar** corners with imported
  material; pairs with the existing Song Book import screen. S–M.
- [ ] **Interchange breadth + fidelity now hardened** — multi-voice **kern**
  (`*^` split spines) and **ABC** (`&` overlay) round-trip; **MEI** multi-staff
  importer (`staffSystemFromMei`); UTF-16/BOM file decoding; a round-trip
  **fidelity harness** + music21 oracle. Supersedes the older "import breadth"
  item above — MEI/kern/ABC/MuseScore import is now robust enough to wire into the
  Song Book. S each (additive, web-safe).
- [ ] **Workshop-facing editor APIs** — `suppressElementIds` (clean element hide
  during live drag, **mus already uses this**) + **view-owned live-drag preview
  `dragPreviewOpacity`** (C10b). Plus engraving the Workshop gets for free:
  **metric-aware secondary beaming** (beams grouped by the meter hierarchy),
  **`Measure.actualDuration`** (explicit irregular/pickup-bar length), every-N
  **measure numbering**, per-group barlines, and layout crash-hardening on
  degenerate spans. → see the **Workshop parity** pass below.
- [ ] **Braille music export** (`.brl`, incl. key/time sigs + chords; tab
  notation complete) — an accessibility angle, not obviously kid-facing. Later.

### Workshop → crisp_notation feature-parity (2026-07-14)

The Composition Workshop is a full touch/desktop score editor, and **G6
multi-instrument authoring is now feature-complete** (2026-07-15, on
origin/main): `MultiPartDocument` (`List<ScoreDocument>` + active part, padded
bar grid, per-part id namespacing) → the full-score `InteractiveMultiPartView`
canvas with a parts strip (add/select/clef/transposition/brace/remove),
multi-part **import** (`multiPartScoreFromMusicXml/Abc/Mei/Kern`), multi-part
**export** (crisp_notation **C11** `multiPartToMusicXml`), and **in-place
editing** on the full score (crisp_notation **C12** `InteractiveMultiPartView`:
staff-tap-to-place, hover ghost, cross-part select, drag repitch). See
`docs/WORKSHOP_G6_HANDOVER.md` + `docs/WORKSHOP_CRISP_NOTATION_CONTRACTS.md`.

**crisp_notation G6 follow-ups (the "left opens") — DONE 2026-07-15:**
- ✅ **C12b — `EditorCaret` on `InteractiveMultiPartView`** (crisp_notation
  `afc283a`): the render paints a caret before its `beforeElementId` — the id
  locates the part, so it lands in the right staff. mus `_mpCaret` feeds the
  active part's caret (namespaced).
- ✅ **C12c — `ElementRegionController` on `InteractiveMultiPartView`**
  (`afc283a`): `RenderMultiPartView implements ElementRegionProvider`; a
  controller binds for marquee / cross-part region queries. mus binds `_regions`
  + shows the rubber-band overlay in multi-part mode (`_applyMpMarquee` selects
  within the most-covered part).
- ✅ **C12a — live drag preview** (no lib change needed): built app-side from the
  existing `suppressElementIds` (hide the dragged note) + placement ghost
  (`onElementDragUpdate` moves it under the pointer) — same visual as single-part
  `dragPreviewOpacity`. A dedicated multi-part `dragPreviewOpacity` (real-glyph
  translation) is an optional future nicety, not required.
- ⏸️ **C11b — multi-part MEI/ABC writers** — **deliberately deferred.** MusicXML
  (`multiPartToMusicXml`, done) is the universal multi-part interchange format;
  adding `multiPartToMei`/`multiPartToAbc` means refactoring the oracle-hardened
  single-part writers for low marginal value + real regression risk. Multi-part
  export stays MusicXML/`.mxl`; other formats export the active part. Revisit
  only if a concrete MEI/ABC multi-part need appears.

**Non-G6 parity polish — assessed & (partly) shipped 2026-07-15:**
- ✅ **Measure numbers in the editor** — crisp_notation `MultiSystemView` gained
  opt-in `showMeasureNumbers` (system-start numbering off `SystemLayout.
  firstMeasure`, paint-only, defaults off — ported from `png_export`'s
  convention; it previously existed only on `StaffView`). Wired a **"Bar
  numbers"** toggle in the Workshop ⋮ menu, wired to **all three** editor
  canvases — single-staff (`MultiSystemView`), grand-staff
  (`InteractiveGrandStaffView`) and multi-part (`InteractiveMultiPartView`) all
  gained the same opt-in system-start numbering. **Feature complete.**
- ✅ **Metric-aware beaming** — already automatic: the layout engine
  (`_computeBeamGroups`) derives beam windows from the meter during layout, so
  the editor needs no opt-in. Nothing to wire.
- ⏸️ **`Measure.actualDuration`** — the model already supports explicit
  irregular-bar lengths (`Measure.actualDuration` + `effectiveDuration`), and the
  editor already handles the pickup case; exposing arbitrary irregular bars is a
  niche editor feature, deferred until asked.
- ✅ **`showNoteNames` overlay** — shipped. crisp_notation gained a
  **`NoteNameStyle`** (letter / German-H / solfège) threaded through the layout
  engine's note-name overlay (was fixed English) + `showNoteNames` on
  `MultiSystemView`; the Workshop **"Note names"** ⋮ toggle overlays each note's
  name **on all three editor canvases** (single-staff, grand-staff, multi-part —
  the flags now forward through the grand-staff/multi-part layout paths too),
  **spelled per the app's note-naming setting** (germanH → H for B, solfège →
  do/re/mi, auto → locale). **Feature complete.**
- ✅ **Per-group barlines in the chrome** — shipped. `MultiPartDocument`
  `toggleBarlineBreakAfter`/`hasBarlineBreakAfter` recompute `barlineGroups`; a
  **"Break barline below"** item in each part's ⋮ menu breaks the systemic
  barline between instrument groups (crisp_notation already paints them). **All
  Workshop→crisp_notation parity items are now shipped.**
Details + the running contract log: `docs/WORKSHOP_PLAN.md` +
`docs/WORKSHOP_CRISP_NOTATION_CONTRACTS.md`.

## Difficulty progression (within each game)

Games start at the easiest concrete slice and widen per level (driven by
stars + `kWinsRequiredForLevelUp`, tuning.dart):

- Reading/Placing: naturals on the staff → ledger lines (middle C!) →
  accidentals → mixed clefs.
- Measure Filler: 4/4 with h/q/e → 2/4, 3/4 → dotted notes → 6/8.
- Scale Detective: C/F/G major → all majors → natural minor → harmonic minor.
- Chord Quiz: major root position → minor (Dur/Moll!) → inversions →
  diminished/augmented.
- Function Quiz: C/F/G major → all keys → minor keys (with harmonic-minor
  dominant) → hear the function (audio).

## Textbook mode — a read-through curriculum (grade 1–10) — PLANNED

**Vision (maintainer, 2026-07-17).** Beyond the minigame grid, a **"read-through"
learning path**: a beautifully, didactically arranged music-theory & practice
**textbook** a learner can start at page one and work through from grade 1 to 10.
Each lesson *teaches* a concept (words + engraved examples + heard examples +
real-song examples), then hands off to the **games that train it**, with an
**ongoing narrative** tying the path together. Two consequences the maintainer
called out: (a) building top-down from a curriculum **reveals our coverage gaps**
(concepts a grade needs that no game/lesson yet trains); (b) coverage will be
**uneven** per concept — that's expected, and the map makes it visible.

### ⚠️ Curriculum source & licensing (READ FIRST — non-negotiable)
The spine must come from a *proven* curriculum, but **the German Bundesländer
music curricula are NOT freely licensed** — "free to read, all rights reserved";
Bayern (ISB) and Baden-Württemberg explicitly forbid redistribution; none carry
CC / Datenlizenz Deutschland (see the "Curriculum / Lehrplan alignment" notes in
`CLAUDE.md`). So we **must never** copy verbatim text, tables, exercises,
graphics or sheet-music excerpts from them. What IS legally reusable:
- **The topic scope / sequence** — *who-teaches-what-when* — is fact, not
  expression; we distil it **in our own words**. (This is already how the app's
  generic Klasse-1–2…9–10 curriculum was built, from re-expressed NRW Grundschule
  + Schleswig-Holstein Sek I scope.)
- **Genuinely open sources** for wording/structure inspiration: **Open Music
  Theory** (CC-BY-SA), Wikipedia/Wikibooks music theory (CC-BY-SA), public-domain
  treatises. Track each source's licence.
- **Public-domain & folk songs** for examples (the Song Book is already
  public-domain children's songs) — freely usable, and the richest teaching hook.
- **§5 UrhG (amtliches Werk)** for a few states' *normative* text is a grey zone;
  the maintainer chose not to rely on it. Don't.
**→ The spine is OUR OWN re-expressed grade-1–10 scope. No verbatim curriculum
text enters the repo.**

### Architecture (proposed)
- **`lib/features/textbook/curriculum.dart`** — pure data: `Grade` → ordered
  `Lesson`s. A `Lesson` = `{ id, gradeBand, title, concept-primer, prose (ARB),
  worked examples (Score/audio), song examples, gameIds[], nextLessonId }`. Pure
  Dart, testable, no UI coupling.
- **Lessons reuse the concept-primer atoms we already built** — the 45 primers in
  `shared/tutorial/primers.dart` ARE the lesson cores. A Lesson wraps a primer +
  extra prose + song examples + the game list. So the primer-quality work already
  done is *directly* the textbook's lesson content.
- **`textbook_screen.dart`** — a paginated reader: prose + engraved examples +
  Listen buttons + "train this" buttons that deep-link into the games, + prev/next
  and a progress spine. Narrative connective text between lessons.
- **`TextbookProgress`** (SharedPreferences) — furthest lesson reached, so
  "continue reading" works; the games' SRI mastery feeds a "you've practised this"
  tick per lesson.

### Song-based examples (start here — highest value, no licensing risk)
Anchor abstract facts to **melodies kids know**, drawn from / extended in the
**Song Book** (public domain). Especially **interval mnemonics** — name the leap
by the tune that starts with it:
- **descending minor 3rd** → "**Kuckuck**" (the cuckoo call).
- **major 2nd up** → "Alle meine Entchen" / "Frère Jacques" start.
- **perfect 4th up** → "Tatütata" (Martinshorn) / "Kommt ein Vogel geflogen".
- **perfect 5th up** → "Morgen kommt der Weihnachtsmann" / "Twinkle" (C–C–G).
- **major 6th up** → "My Bonnie".
- **octave** → "Somewhere over the Rainbow".
These become: (1) worked examples inside the interval lessons; (2) an
`intervalSongs` table the **Interval** games cite as a hint/mnemonic; (3) Song
Book entries we author/extend. Each carries its source + public-domain check.

### Gap analysis (the deliverable that "reveals where we don't cover")
A pure function + a test mapping **each re-expressed curriculum concept →
{lesson?, primer?, gameIds[]}** and printing the **uncovered** ones (a concept
with no game, or a grade band with a thin lesson). Both a planning artefact and a
coverage guard. Run it first — it orders all the work below.

### Phasing
1. **Curriculum spine data model + gap analysis** (pure Dart + test). Reveals gaps.
2. **Song-example layer**: `intervalSongs` (+ other mnemonic tables) wired into
   the interval primers/games; extend the Song Book where a song is missing.
   *(No new UI; immediate learner value.)*
3. **Lesson model** wrapping the existing primers + prose + song examples + game
   links; author grade-band prose (our words).
4. **Textbook reader UI** + narrative + progress + game deep-links.
5. **Fill the gaps** the analysis found (new lessons/games for uncovered concepts).

**Status (2026-07-17): phases 0–5 all shipped; the syllabus is fully covered and
readable end-to-end.**
- **Phase 0** — primers to the 9yo bar (every step engraved + heard).
- **Phase 1** — `concept_map.dart` (70 concepts, grade 1–10, our words) +
  `coverage_gaps.dart` + the gap-report test.
- **Phase 2** — song mnemonics: `core/curriculum/interval_songs.dart` wired into
  the **Interval Detective** (Kuckuck = falling minor 3rd, etc.).
- **Phase 3** — narrative + **full i18n**: `features/textbook/textbook_i18n.dart`
  (ARB-backed, de/en) localises all 70 concept titles, the 19 concept-area
  sub-headers and 5 grade-band short labels, plus a **narrative intro paragraph
  per grade band**. The reader groups each band's concepts by area (sub-headers,
  first-appearance order) so it reads like a book.
- **Phase 4** — the read-through reader (`textbook_screen.dart`) + 📖 home button.
- **Phase 5 — all 8 gaps FILLED:** verse/chorus + ABA/rondo form (`form_read`),
  syncopation (`sync_read`), triplets (`triplet_read`), ornaments
  (`ornament_read`), **modulation** (`modulation_ear`), **modes** (`mode_ear`),
  **instrument families** (`instrument_family`).
- **Coverage now: 137/137 games placed (100%), 0 untrained concepts, 0 orphans.**

Remaining (optional): ~~richer per-concept lesson prose beyond the primers~~ **first
tranche SHIPPED** (`2f63709` — 17 concepts, EN/DE, fallback-safe; ~53 concepts
still open, same pattern); the bachelor-tier extension (draw facts from the OER
registry below); ~~the AnaVis-style form view~~ **SHIPPED** (`2f63709` —
`FormAnalysisView` as the form concepts' lesson content); and **TTS narration**
(below).

### TTS narration — read the lessons + instructions aloud (maintainer, 2026-07-17)
Use TTS to read out the text explanations / instructions of the minigames and the
textbook. High learnability value: a **pre-reader (6–8yo)** can *hear* a lesson or
a game's how-to-play even before they can read it, and it makes the app accessible.

**Slice 1 — SHIPPED (2026-07-17).** `core/services/tts_service.dart`: a
`TtsBackend`-abstracted `TtsService` (mirrors `AudioService`'s `soundOn` gate),
locale-aware (`de→de-DE`, else `en-US`), best-effort (a missing OS voice degrades
to silence). Backend = `flutter_tts` (platform AVSpeechSynthesizer / Android TTS /
web SpeechSynthesis — on-device, offline, free). Wired a **🗣 read-aloud button**
into the shared **tutorial sheet**, so **both** the textbook lessons *and* every
game's how-to primer get narration from one change (the reader's "Read the lesson"
and the games' "?" both open this sheet). Provided in `main.dart`; `soundOn` synced
from settings alongside AudioService. Safe when unprovided (widget tests degrade to
no button). Tests: `tts_service_test` (fake backend — gating, voice mapping,
stop) + tutorial tests green. ⚠ needs `pod install` before the next Apple build
(new plugin); CI (analyze+test) unaffected.

**Slice 2 — SHIPPED (2026-07-17): the CrispASR neural backend, via CrispASR's own
model registry + downloader.** The higher-quality voice, behind the same seam.
`core/audio/tts/`:
- `crispasr_tts_backend.dart` — `CrispAsrTtsBackend implements TtsBackend` over the
  **`crispasr`** pub package (pure-Dart FFI → `libcrispasr`, ggml). Backend =
  **Kokoro** (82 M, Apache-2.0, multilingual). A background-isolate job
  (`runKokoroJob`) resolves the model+voice via CrispASR's **registry** and
  downloads through `cacheEnsureFile` (its C-side downloader — the same `-m auto`
  path the CLI + CrisperWeaver use); then `synthesize()` (~3 s → 24 kHz PCM) → PCM16
  → `wavBytes` → `AudioService.playWavBytes` (master sound switch still governs it).
  NaN/empty decode → null → silent fallback.
- `kokoro_model_store.dart` — **no hand-rolled URLs**: `registryLookup('kokoro')`
  gives the already-published `cstr/kokoro-82m-GGUF` model URL; voices are
  `af_heart` (en) / `df_victoria` (de) from `cstr/kokoro-voices-GGUF`; files cache
  into CrispASR's own cache (`~/.cache/crispasr`, override for a mobile sandbox).
  `isReady()` = lib loadable + model already cached.
- **Download is consent-gated**: playback never fetches (uses the model only if
  cached, else the platform voice); `backend.download(lang)` is the explicit opt-in
  (a settings action, mirroring CrisperWeaver's model manager).
- `tts_neural.dart` — conditional-import facade (mirrors `aec_capability.dart`):
  io/ffi impl compiles only where `dart:io` exists; **web gets a null stub**.
- `TtsService` **prefers neural when `neuralReady()` passes, else platform**.

**Verified:** the app's compiled dep resolves the **registry → published cstr HF
URL** (flutter test) AND the real macOS synth path (`libcrispasr.dylib` → Kokoro →
valid German audio, peak-checked); plus fake-seam unit tests for
playback/download-gating/locale routing. Download ABI symbols
(`crispasr_cache_ensure_file_abi` etc.) confirmed present in the dylib. 16 TTS tests
green; analyze clean (lib+test). Dep `crispasr: ^0.8.11` (pub.dev) → CI needs no
native lib.

**Slice 3 — SHIPPED (2026-07-17): the settings download trigger.** A **"Natural
voice (HD)" tile** in Settings (below the sound switch) — `_HdVoiceTile` +
`TtsService.neuralSupported/neuralReady/downloadNeuralVoice` + `NeuralTts` holder
(now carries `supported`/`download` too). It's **shown only where the native lib
loads** (invisible until libcrispasr is bundled), offers a one-tap **Download
(~135 MB)** → spinner → "On ✓"; once cached, narration auto-upgrades to the neural
voice. Degrades gracefully with no TtsService (settings tests untouched). EN/DE
ARB; 24 TTS/settings tests green; analyze clean.

**Slice 4 — SHIPPED (2026-07-17): macOS lib bundling (dev-verified).** `libcrispasr`
is 9.6 MB but drags in **8 more dylibs** (ggml ×5 + Homebrew opus/ogg), several
referencing the maintainer's Cellar/build tree by absolute path. `tool/
bundle_macos_tts.sh` (a mini `dylibbundler` in `install_name_tool`+`codesign`)
collects all 9 **self-contained** (copy-by-referenced-name, rewrite ids/deps to
`@rpath`, strip foreign rpaths to `@loader_path`, ad-hoc sign) and **statically
verifies** it. `KokoroModelStore.libPath()` gains a resolution cascade
(override → `.app`/Contents/Frameworks → `~/.cache/crispasr` → default). **Verified:
synth runs through the bundled set with only `@loader_path` on the rpath** (loads
the bundle's ggml, not the machine's) → portable/`.app`-ready. Dev flow: run the
script (→ `~/.cache/crispasr`), `flutter run macos`, the HD tile appears. Docs +
App-Store caveats in `docs/TTS_MACOS.md`; cascade unit-tested. Shared `macos/`
Xcode project intentionally NOT modified (multi-agent safety) — the release
Frameworks embed is documented for a release worktree.

**Remaining work:**
1. **Release `.app` embed** — add the Copy-Files-to-Frameworks phase (per
   `docs/TTS_MACOS.md`) in a release worktree + Developer-ID re-sign; then
   **iOS** xcframework, **Android** `.so` per-ABI, **web** WASM. Each platform
   falls back to flutter_tts until its lib ships. (The HD-voice tile then works.)
2. **German quality** (optional): fetch the `kokoro-de-hui-base` backbone (a second
   ~135 MB model) + route `-l de` for a cleaner German phonemizer; expose
   `set_length_scale` as a kid-friendly slower rate.

**Other follow-ups:** a dedicated *narration* toggle (accessibility) separate from
the master sound switch; **auto-narrate** a step when its example plays (opt-in).

### Extending the syllabus toward bachelor level (2026-07-17)
The grade-1–10 spine is the floor; the concept map extends **upward toward
undergraduate music theory** the same way (more bands / an `undergrad` tier). Draw
structure & facts from established OER — but **the licence governs how**:

| Source | Licence (verify per work) | How we may use it |
|---|---|---|
| **Open Music Theory 2** | CC-BY-SA 4.0 | facts + (adapted text OK **if** we attribute & share-alike the derived text) |
| **Understanding Music: Past & Present** (Clark et al.) | CC-BY-SA 4.0 | same as above |
| **Music Theory for the 21st-C Classroom** (Hutchinson) | **GFDL** | **facts/scope only — re-express.** GFDL is copyleft for *manuals*; shipping adapted GFDL text would obligate GFDL on the derivative, incompatible with our MIT/CC-BY mix → do NOT ship verbatim/adapted, use as a reference |
| **Kyle Gullings OER** (Undergrad Music Theory) | often CC-BY-**NC**(-SA) | **facts only** — NC forbids our commercial (App Store) use of the *text*; re-express is fine |
| **Multimodal Musicianship** (Malawey) | verify (Pressbooks OER, often CC-BY-NC-SA) | facts only unless a CC-BY/BY-SA item |
| **Open Music Academy** (openmusic.academy) | per-item, often CC-BY-SA | facts + adapt CC-BY(-SA) items with attribution |
| **ELMU** (E-Learning Plattform Musik) | verify per resource | facts; adapt only clearly CC-BY(-SA) items |
| **OER-Musik.de** (U. Kaiser OpenBooks) | typically CC-BY-SA | facts + adapt with attribution/share-alike |
| **Projekt #gis** (int'l students) | verify (OER) | facts; adapt only CC-BY(-SA) items |

**Governing rule (unchanged):** our default for *every* source is **re-express the
facts/structure in our own words** — always legal, sidesteps all licences.
Verbatim/adapted text is considered ONLY for **CC-BY / CC-BY-SA** works (with
attribution; SA obligates same-licence on the derived text), **never** for
**CC-BY-NC** (app is commercial) or **GFDL** (copyleft/incompatible). Keep a
per-source licence registry (`assets/licenses/` + the About page) for anything we
adapt. When unsure, re-express.

### AnaVis-style analysis view (idea → fills the *form* gap)
The maintainer asks: *can we get close to AnaVis?* AnaVis visualises musical
**form/harmonic analysis** as a colour-coded timeline (phrase/section blocks,
cadences) aligned to the music. That is exactly the **musical_form / phrasing**
concepts the gap report flags as untrained. Proposal: a **form-analysis view** —
a horizontal timeline under a `crisp_notation` score (or a playing cursor) with
labelled colour spans (A / B / A′ sections, antecedent/consequent phrases,
cadence points), and a matching **"label the form" minigame**. Feasible app-side
(score + a custom span-timeline widget); no new library dep. Tracks as: fills the
form gap **and** seeds an analysis feature. Later: harmonic-function spans
(T/S/D colouring) over a progression.
**SHIPPED (`2f63709`, `d3cb309`):** the "label the form" minigame (`form_read`) + a
non-quiz **`FormAnalysisView`** (`features/games/composition/form_analysis_view.dart`,
built on `FormTimeline`) that plays a piece's A/B/A′ sections section-by-section
**over an engraved `crisp_notation` score** (one bar per section), wired into the
Textbook's form concepts (`musical_form`/`song_form`) as a "See the form" lesson;
plus a **`HarmonyAnalysisView`** that colours a chord progression by function
(tonic/subdominant/dominant, with a legend + tap-to-hear), wired into
`harmonic_function`/`cadences` as "See the harmony"; plus a standalone
**`AnalysisHubScreen`** ("See the Music", `analysis_view` tile) hosting both. The
harmony view now engraves the progression as a real score (one whole-note chord
per bar) with the T/S/D spans aligned under it and cadence markers under the
final chord (`6107392`). **The AnaVis idea is fully realised.**

## Delivery

- GitHub: `CrispStrobe/cometbeat` (app), `CrispStrobe/crisp_notation` (lib).
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): every push/PR runs format + analyze +
  test and uploads coverage (~85% of `lib/`). It checks out `crisp_notation` as a
  sibling so the `../crisp_notation` path dependency resolves on the runner.
  Analyzer is strict (`strict-casts`/`strict-raw-types`); the `build` symlink
  is untracked (it points at a dev-only SSD path and would dangle on CI).
- Web: Vercel (`mus` project), prebuilt `build/web`, same pattern as voc.
  A root `.vercelignore` drops the Flutter build's `*.symbols` debug maps
  (~8 MB, never fetched at runtime) from the upload; the served bundle is
  brotli (main.dart.js ~924 KB, canvaskit.wasm ~2.85 MB, fonts tree-shaken).
- pub.dev publication of crisp_notation: deliberately **not yet** (maintainer
  decision); everything is consumed via path/git.

The bet: a child with **no** prior music knowledge should be able to open any
minigame, be taught the facts it needs (with heard + seen examples), and play it
through. Plus fix a sound regression and give sound a global switch. (Original
structural map, now mostly addressed: every screen built its own AppBar — a
shared `GameAppBar` now exists but isn't swept in yet; the mascot lived only in
`FeedbackLine` — now also presents in `RoundHeader`; the tutorial/help system is
built and live.)

### P0 — App-silence regression
Symptom: audio goes silent app-wide, suspected after play-along. Likely cause:
there is **no global audio-session / `AudioContext`** (`main.dart`, `AudioService`),
so the `record` mic flips the iOS/Android session to record/`playAndRecord` (routes
to the quiet earpiece) and does not restore it, muting `audioplayers` afterwards.
Fix: set a global playback `AudioContext` (speaker-routed, mixes/ducks) once at
startup; have `MicrophonePitchService.stop()` restore it; verify metronome +
backing + SFX are audible before **and after** using the mic. (No repro device
here — validate on macOS/web locally + reason from the session model; confirm on
hardware in (e)-style testing.)

### P0 — Global sound on/off toggle in the top bar
- **Behavior:** one chokepoint — gate `AudioService._play()` with `if (!soundOn) return;`
  (`core/services/audio_service.dart`). Mutes notes/chords/SFX/ticks/backing for
  all 97 games at once; the **mic is unaffected** (intonation games still work).
- **State:** add `soundOn` to `SettingsService` (SharedPreferences, mirrors the
  existing `showTimer`/`instrument` pattern), synced to `AudioService` at
  `main.dart` where `instrument` already is.
- **UI (app-wide):** there is no shared AppBar, so introduce a shared
  **`GameAppBar`** helper (a `PreferredSizeWidget`) that carries the speaker
  on/off action **and** the tutorial "?" button (below), and migrate game
  screens onto it module-by-module. Ship the toggle immediately on Home +
  Settings; the per-game top-bar icon lands as screens adopt `GameAppBar`.

### P1 — Mascot: from idle prop to guide
`NoteMascot` (`shared/widgets/note_mascot.dart`, moods idle/happy/oops) currently
sits in `FeedbackLine` (between the question and the 4 options, 53 screens) doing
nothing at rest. Move it to a **presenter** role: a `MascotPrompt` (mascot +
speech bubble that reads the question) inside `RoundHeader`, **before** the
question; default `FeedbackLine.showMascot = false` (feedback text stays). Give
the mascot a gentle **idle animation** (breathe/blink/sway) so it's alive, and
keep the happy/oops reactions. Editing the two shared widgets
(`game_widgets.dart`, `note_mascot.dart`) reaches every game uniformly.

### P1→P2 — Tutorials for every minigame (the big one)
Each game gets a short, **illustrated + playable** explanation of exactly the
musical facts it drills, so a zero-knowledge child can clear it.
- **Framework:** a `Tutorial` model = ordered steps, each with text + optional
  **notation** (`StaffView`/`kidsScoreTheme`) + optional **"listen" example**
  (`AudioService.playSequence`/`playMidiChord`/…). A `TutorialSheet` renders it.
  Shown **auto on first entry** (persist "seen" per game id) and reopenable via
  the **"?"** in `GameAppBar`. New optional hook on `GameInfo`
  (`game_registry.dart`), e.g. `Tutorial Function(AppLocalizations)? tutorial`.
- **Content:** author module-by-module (10 modules, 97 games), EN/DE in the
  ARBs, teaching the underlying knowledge — staff & clefs, note/rest values &
  beats, meter/measures, scales (Dur/Moll), intervals & chords, harmony (T/S/D),
  the cello/guitar/piano corners — each with a heard example and a shown example.
  Reuse one shared "primer" per module where games overlap, specialized per game.
- **Phasing:** (1) framework + "?" + first-run gating + `GameAppBar`; (2)
  author the note-reading + note-values primers (highest-traffic); (3) sweep the
  remaining modules. Coordinate ARB/`game_registry` edits (hot files) with the
  parallel agents.

## Competitive analysis & opportunity roadmap

Benchmarked against 30+ music-learning apps (mid-2026, four research sweeps:
gamified-instrument, theory/ear-training, kids-focused, and
sight-reading/composition + DACH). Competitor names are deliberately kept out of
this repo; the notes below describe capability *categories*, not products.

### The strategic read

- **Our real competition is not the big paid instrument-tutor apps.** Those are
  adult-first, treat notation as a display mode, and have no German-curriculum
  tie-in. In the DACH market we compete with a couple of free incumbents (a
  curriculum-aligned school platform and a public-broadcaster kids' site) plus a
  thin cluster of small theory/notation tools.
- **The children's notation-literacy niche is genuinely thin.** German teaching
  materials note that note-reading is required in every Bundesland yet there is
  little kindgerechtes Unterrichtsmaterial zum Notenlernen — that gap is the
  opening.
- **Two open moats:** explicit **Lehrplan alignment** (only the incumbent school
  platform claims it) and **genuinely bilingual EN/DE pedagogy** (rivals are
  German-only or English apps with translated strings — almost none are built
  bilingual).
- **Where we already lead** (rare among kids' apps): SM-2 spaced repetition,
  real four-clef notation, theory/harmony depth (T/S/D, cadences), a composition
  sandbox with MusicXML export, bilingual EN/DE — and now **live mic input**.
- **The structural gap that used to set the strong rivals apart — live
  real-instrument input — is now closed on the mic side** (play-along/sing-along,
  tuner, chord listener; see HISTORY). MIDI input remains open.

### Opportunity backlog (implement top-to-bottom)

Effort S/M/L; fit ♪–♪♪♪ (mission fit for a kids' notation/theory app). Source =
the app category the idea comes from. Shipped items live in
[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#opportunity-backlog--shipped).

**Strategic bets — extend the SM-2 / notation core**
- [ ] Parent view + multi-child profiles. *(kids' practice apps.) M · ♪♪.*

- [x] Lehrplan alignment + German framing. **Shipped**: a **Curriculum** screen —
  generic progress levels tied to **school years** (Klasse 1–2 … 9–10), each
  topic mapped to the games that drill it, with a *readiness* meter from the
  child's stars, a "continue here" marker on the recommended level, and
  per-level / weakest-topic practice runs. Readiness blends **star coverage ×
  SM-2 retention** (`SriService.masteryUnder(namespace)`), so it reflects both
  breadth and whether skills actually stuck. The engine (`Curriculum → Level →
  Topic → gameIds`) keeps per-region variants as drop-in data. *Open: optional
  per-Bundesland variants (rough matching is fine).*
- [ ] Sound-toy creative modes that feed notation (grid composer + geometric
  rhythm toy for pre-readers). *(browser music sound-toys.) M · ♪♪.*
- [ ] Color-coded kids' notation editor with MusicXML/MIDI export. *(kids'
  notation-editor apps.) M · ♪♪.* Closest to our existing sandbox.
- [ ] Teacher / LMS layer for school licensing (roster, assign-and-track, Google
  Classroom). *(classroom notation/DAW platforms.) L · ♪♪.* Schools buy per-seat.

**Big swings — category table-stakes, heavy lift**
- [x] Real-instrument input — **mic side shipped**: live pitch/chroma detection
  powers **Play-along / Sing-along** (moving-score grading), a **Tuner**, and a
  **Chord Listener** ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#live-microphone--pitch-detection)).
  *Open: MIDI input; wiring mic grading into more of the corners.*
- [ ] Generative sight-reading + performance grading — endless non-repeating
  exercises scored for pitch & rhythm. *(generative sight-reading services.) L · ♪♪♪.*
  Answers the teacher-reported material shortage directly. *(Staff Runner is the
  kid-scale stepping stone; mic grading now exists to score the performance.)*

### Live-mic follow-ups (the mic pipeline is shipped — exploit it)

Now that live pitch/chroma detection, the `PlayAlongEngine`, and the moving-score
UI exist, these are high value ÷ effort because the hard infra is done:

- [x] **"Perform It" — mic-graded reading.** **Shipped**
  ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#live-microphone--pitch-detection)): a note is shown;
  the child **plays or sings it** and the pitch detector verifies it
  (octave-agnostic, sustained-match), instead of tapping a letter. Feeds the
  shared `note_reading.<clef>.*` SM-2 pool. The kid-scale core of the
  generative-sight-reading big swing.
- [x] **Sing-back ear training.** **Shipped**
  ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#live-microphone--pitch-detection)): a note plays; the
  child sings it back and the mic grades it (octave-agnostic). Target is *heard*,
  not shown — trains pitch memory & matching, needs no instrument. Feeds the ear
  pool `scales.hear.*`.
- [ ] **Play-along for the Song Book.** Extend play/sing-along to the real
  public-domain songs — play or sing Twinkle & co. against the moving score. *M · ♪♪.*
- [~] **Mic grading in the instrument corners.** "Play this note/string/finger"
  verified by the mic. **Cello shipped**
  ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#live-microphone--pitch-detection)): a first-position
  note + string/finger hint, played on the real cello and graded by the mic
  (octave-agnostic, feeds `cello.play.*`). Guitar & piano corners still open. *M · ♪♪.*
- [ ] **Parent view + multi-child profiles.** *(kids' practice apps. M · ♪♪.)* A
  parent dashboard over the curriculum **readiness** — each child's school-year
  progress at a glance; per-child profiles. (Also listed under Strategic bets.)

Caveats: competitor prices/age-ratings drift; some DACH adoption/award figures
are self-reported — verify before external citation.

## Gamified formats (from the sibling-app survey)

New *interaction mechanics* surveyed across `../voc` and `../space_math_academy`.
Shipped formats (memory pairs, sequence, sort-into-buckets, swipe, falling-notes,
connect-a-line) live in [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#gamified-formats--shipped).
Sub-variant sweep **mostly done** (Jul 2026 batch): shipped **Longest First**
(note-value ordering), **In the Scale?** (swipe membership), **High or Low?** +
**Sharp or Flat?** (two-basket sorts on pitch-direction / accidental-sign),
**Higher or Lower?** (direction-by-ear), **Step or Skip?** (motion reading), and
**Connect the Steps** (interval↔number, a 3rd Connect-the-Notes mode). Details in
[HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#gamified-formats--shipped). Still open from this survey:

- [x] **Major/minor sort** — **shipped** (`major_minor_sort`, chords): drag written
  triads into Major / Minor baskets by reading their quality on the staff
  (Diminished joins at 2★); the chord sounds on a correct drop. The reading twin of
  the aural `major_minor_ear`. SRI `chords.quality.<major|minor|diminished>`.
- [ ] **Falling-notes "catch the longest"** — a note-*values* mode of the arcade.
  *Caveat: `falling_notes_screen.dart` is ~930 lines of ticker/combo logic and
  its tests lean on the animation clock — a real lift, and less tap-robust than
  everything else in the batch. Budget accordingly.*
- [ ] **Melody-recall ear variant** of the sequence format — hear a 3–5 note
  tune, tap it back. *Check overlap first: `melody_echo`, `echo_sequence`, and
  `sound_echo` already exist; only build if it adds a distinct twist (e.g.
  tap-back on a staff rather than a keyboard).*

### Toy-inspired mechanics (electronic-toy lineage)

Classic hand-held electronic music/reaction toys, reimagined for notation & ear
training. Shipped: Sound Echo, Follow the Conductor
([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#toy-inspired-mechanics--shipped)).

- [x] **Strum toy** — swipe/strum across the screen to sound a chord or arpeggio;
  a free "air-instrument" jam built on the existing fretboard/keyboard widgets. *S–M.*
  **Shipped** ([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#toy-inspired-mechanics--shipped)).
- [ ] **Loop mixer** — tap/place cards that each trigger a synced musical loop
  (bass / chords / melody / drums), layering a mix in time. Creative sound-toy.
  *L — needs multi-track synced loop playback.*
- [ ] **Two-hand split** — left and right zones each run their own short
  sequence/beat to keep going at once (piano-hands coordination). *M–L, advanced.*
- [ ] **Move-to-the-beat caller** — a move/gesture is called on each beat; perform
  it in time (rhythm + reaction). *M.*

### New minigame concepts (original — not from the surveys)

Fresh ideas that fit the machinery we already have (crisp_notation notation, pure-Dart
audio, the SM-2 engine, the falling/connect/reaction engines) and target skills
the curriculum doesn't yet drill.

**All shipped** — Ledger Leap, Key Detective, Odd One Out, Note Whack, Interval
Ladder, Staff Runner, Chord Grip Hero, Dynamics & Tempo Charades, Note Snake, and
Recital Mode all live now
([HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#original-concepts--shipped)). New original ideas get
added here as they come up.

## Loop Mixer 2.0 — the groovebox ladder (roadmap)

**STATUS 2026-07-17: ALL SLICES SHIPPED — the ladder is complete** (slices
1–10; slice 5 deferred to the Tracker by design). See the board + HISTORY.md.
Follow-ups (groove→score export, native-AEC jam grading) are specced in
[`LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md`](LOOP_MIXER_FOLLOWUPS_HANDOVER.md).

Evolve the shipped Loop Mixer (`32ebb96`) from kid toy into something adults
find genuinely fascinating. Guiding idea: **kids love cause-and-effect; adults
love depth that reveals itself** — a toy that turns out to be an instrument,
a system that responds to *you* (the mic!), and output worth keeping. The
ladder is also a stealth curriculum: layers → arrangement → harmony → rhythm
design → ear-to-instrument. Depth stays behind the shelf (Sandbox/Studio
philosophy): the five-cards surface never gets harder. Division of labour vs.
the **Tracker** (opus, `TRACKER_HANDOVER.md`): the Tracker is the *editing*
surface (pattern grids, sample instruments); the Loop Mixer is the *playing*
surface (layering, feel, harmony, generativity, the mic). Both sit on the same
`loop_engine.dart`/`mixStems` foundation — engine work here is additive and
keeps existing signatures stable.

**Architecture spine** (decides everything else):
- **`GrooveSpec`** — one small serializable value object = the entire groove
  state (enabled set, tempo, swing, per-track variant + level, progression,
  seed). Engine renders `spec → WAV` (pure, cached). Makes the share token,
  save slots and tests trivial.
- **Patterns become DATA, not closures** (drums = per-voice hit rows; melodic
  = (midis, lengthSteps) cells) so variants, engraving, sing-a-track and
  generative variation all operate on one model — and the Tracker can reuse it.
- **Seam scheduler** — the single looping player stays for the steady state
  (native loop = perfectly gapless); a second player only swaps a *changed*
  render at the next loop boundary (fills, variation, infinite mode). Instant
  toggles keep the shipped phase-preserving `play(position:)` path.
- Stay offline-render + audioplayers until an actual wall (live filter sweeps
  / continuous tempo bend would need a streaming path — flag, don't build).

**Slices** (each independently shippable, in order):
1. ✅ v1 shipped (`32ebb96`).
2. **Engine v2** — GrooveSpec + data patterns + **swing** (off-eighth delay
   0–60%, the biggest feel-per-LOC win) + **per-track variants** (A/B/C) +
   **euclidean drum generator** (Bjorklund; hits/rotation per voice) +
   per-card **level**. Pure Dart + tests; screen keeps the v1 surface.
3. **Screen v2 + seam scheduler** — swing slider, variant cycling on cards,
   level control, bar-quantized "armed" apply for seam-timed changes, auto
   drum-fill every 4th loop.
4. **Chord progression lane** — pick I–V–vi–IV / I–IV–V–I / vi–IV–I–V; loop
   becomes 4 bars (1 per chord); bass + chords render chord-relative, melody
   stays C-pentatonic (works over the axis progressions). Suddenly it's a song.
5. ~~Step editor~~ — **deferred to the Tracker** (its Sandbox view IS the
   step editor, over the same engine). No duplicate grid UI here.
6. **Live engraving** — the groove as a real multi-part crisp_notation score
   in a collapsible panel (the app's signature "you're writing notation" trick).
7. **Keep it** — WAV export/share (bytes already exist), groove **share
   token** (GrooveSpec → short base64 string, serverless, matches the
   no-tracking stance), save slots (mirror `user_songs_service`).
8. **Infinite mode** — seeded per-iteration variation via the seam scheduler
   (ghost notes, melody ornaments, arrangement drift). Never the same twice.
9. **Sing a track into existence** — hum a riff → MPM pitch track → quantize
   to key + step grid → a sixth card plays it on the synth (reuse Free Sing /
   melody recorder pipeline). The headline feature. (Distinct from the
   Tracker's record-your-voice-as-*instrument* — this is melody *capture*.)
10. **Beatbox → drum card** (onset + crude kick/snare/hat classification) and
    **Jam mode** (groove plays, child plays cello over it through the AEC
    path, app shows what they play vs. the harmony — the loop mixer becomes a
    play-along backing band). Big; needs the AEC on-device path.

## Ideas backlog for the next agent (Jul 2026 handoff)

Brain-dump of every game/feature idea still on the table after the Jul-2026
web-safe batch, ranked roughly by value ÷ effort. **All are web-safe (no native
FFI) unless flagged.** Reuse the existing scaffolds — a new game is one `GameInfo`
in `game_registry.dart` + a screen + a `kStarThresholds` bracket in
`core/tuning.dart` + ARB keys (EN/DE) + a widget test. Follow the strict
`dart format` → `flutter analyze` (whole project) → `flutter test` → commit →
push → watch-CI loop, and keep the board above in sync (parallel agents!).

**Reusable scaffolds proven this batch (copy them, don't reinvent):**
- *Two-basket sort* — `pitch_sort_screen.dart` / `accidental_sort_screen.dart`
  (Draggable→DragTarget, `onWillAcceptWithDetails` gates the drop). Test drives
  real drags and tries each basket until one accepts (`pitch_sort_test.dart`).
- *Binary ear* — `direction_ear_screen.dart` (replay button + two answer
  buttons; `@visibleForTesting` tester interface exposes the correct answer so
  the test taps it).
- *Binary staff-read* — `step_skip_screen.dart` (staff card + two buttons).
- *Swipe/tap card* — `in_scale_screen.dart` (swipe + tap labels + arrow keys).
- *Connect-a-line* — add a `ConnectMode` case to `connect_line_screen.dart`.
- All staff-based tests **must** use `pumpGame`/`useGameSurface` (CI's 800×600
  surface throws `getElementPoint` otherwise — see the board's ✅ note).

### A. Tap-robust minigames that fill a real skill gap (best value)
- [x] **Whole-step or Half-step?** — **shipped** (Noten lesen): read a 2nd on the
  staff and tap tone vs semitone (half steps hide at E–F/B–C), and hear the
  interval; treble at 1★, +bass at 2★. SRI `reading.tone.<whole|half>`. See
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped).
- [x] **Same or Different?** (binary ear) — **shipped** (Tonleitern): two notes
  play → same pitch or different; clear leap → subtler gaps at 2★. SRI
  `pitch.hear.<same|diff>`. See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped).
- [x] **Which Clef?** (binary) — **shipped** (Noten lesen): a bare clef on an
  empty staff; tap Treble or Bass, widening to Alto/Tenor at 2★. SRI
  `reading.clef.<name>`. See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#crisp_notation-powered--shipped).
- [x] **Dotted or Not?** (two-basket sort) — **shipped** (Notenwerte): drag note
  glyphs into Dotted/Plain baskets by reading the augmentation dot (value varies
  so shape alone doesn't give it away). SRI `note_values.dot.<dotted|plain>`. See
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#gamified-formats--shipped).
- [x] **Ascending or Descending?** (binary ear) — **shipped** (Tonleitern): a 3–4
  note run plays → climbs up or steps down; 4 notes at 2★. A step past Higher or
  Lower?. SRI `pitch.hear.<asc|desc>`. See
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md#gamified-formats--shipped).
- [x] **Count the Notes** (ear) — **shipped** (Tonleitern): a phrase of 2/3/4
  distinct notes plays → tap how many you heard. Aural attention, no staff, three
  answer buttons, `playPhrase`. SRI `pitch.hear.count<n>`. See
  [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md).

### B. Cheap depth — widen games that already exist (S effort each)
- [~] **Bass-clef variants** of the new sorts/readers — a `clef` constructor
  param + a second `GameInfo` doubles the content (mirror how `note_reading` /
  `place_note` ship treble + bass). **Shipped:** ✅ *Step or Skip? (bass)*
  (`step_skip_bass`) · ✅ *High or Low? (bass)* (`pitch_sort_bass`) — each with
  its own `progressId` so treble progress is untouched. · ✅ *Sharp or Flat?
  (bass)* (`accidental_sort_bass`). · ✅ *Find the Key (bass)* (`key_find_bass`,
  keyboard) — the staff→piano bridge, bass clef: the `PianoKeyboard` shifts two
  octaves down (C2..B3) so the low staff naturals (G2..A3) land on real keys;
  own `progressId`, and the SRI token carries the octave so bass items never
  collide with treble. (`Connect the Notes` already ships `connect_line_bass`.)
- [x] **Step, Skip, or Leap?** — **shipped**: `step_skip` (and its bass variant)
  becomes a 3-way at 2★ — Step (2nd) / Skip (3rd–4th) / Leap (5th+), a third
  answer button + `reading.motion.leap`; below 2★ it stays the binary drill.
- [x] **3-basket sorts** — **shipped**: *Sharp or Flat?* (`accidental_sort`, +bass)
  widens to a **Sharp / Natural / Flat** 3-basket sort at 2★; below 2★ it stays
  the binary ♯/♭ drill (mirrors Step→Skip→Leap). The natural glyph (♮) is real —
  crisp_notation renders it via `NoteElement.showAccidental` on an unaltered
  pitch (`alter:0 + showAccidental:true → accidentalNatural`, verified at the
  layout level). Card sign refactored bool→`int alter` (+1/0/-1). SRI gains
  `accidentals.sign.natural`.
- [~] **More Connect modes** — note↔piano-key, rest↔note-value, Italian-term↔
  meaning, dynamic-mark↔meaning, instrument↔clef. Each is one `ConnectMode` case.
  **Shipped:** ✅ *Connect the Dynamics* (`connect_dynamics`, note_values) — match
  each dynamic mark glyph (pp…ff) to its meaning word (very soft…very loud); 4
  clear steps for beginners, mp/mf join at 2★. SRI `reading.dynamics.*` (shared
  with `dynamics_duel`, so the reading and compare-loudness drills reinforce one
  skill). ✅ *Connect the Rests* (`connect_rests`, note_values) — match each rest
  glyph to the note it equals in length (quarter rest ↔ "quarter note"); whole/
  half/quarter/eighth for beginners, sixteenth at 2★. SRI `note_values.rest.*`.
  ✅ *Connect the Tempo Words* (`connect_tempo`, note_values) — match each Italian
  tempo word to its meaning (Largo ↔ "very slow"); Largo/Adagio/Allegro/Presto
  for beginners, the middle terms (Andante/Moderato/Vivace) at 2★. SRI
  `reading.tempo.*` (shared with `tempo_duel`). ✅ *Connect the Beats*
  (`connect_beats`, note_values) — match each note-value glyph to how many beats
  it lasts in 4/4 (whole 4 / half 2 / quarter 1 / eighth ½; sixteenth ¼ at 2★).
  SRI `note_values.beats.*` — the duration-in-beats twin of the symbols mode
  (which teaches the *name*). Remaining Connect idea worth doing: instrument↔clef
  — but awkward cardinality (few clefs, many instruments) makes a weak 4-pair
  round; parked. NB the **note↔piano-key** bridge is already its own game, not a
  Connect mode: `key_find` (staff note → tap the key) now ships treble **and**
  bass, both on the reusable `lib/shared/widgets/piano_keyboard.dart`
  (`PianoKeyboard`, already used across ~7 games).

### C. Reading vocabulary the curriculum wants but we don't drill
- [x] **Louder or Softer?** — **shipped** (`dynamics_duel`, note_values): two
  SMuFL dynamic glyphs (pp…ff) as cards, tap the louder; a compare-two duel like
  Faster or Slower?. SRI `reading.dynamics.<mark>`. (`charades` covers the aural
  side; this is the reading side.)
- [x] **Faster or Slower?** — **shipped** (`tempo_duel`, note_values): two Italian
  tempo terms (Largo…Presto) as cards, tap the faster; a compare-two duel like
  Duration Duel but text-based. SRI `reading.tempo.<term>`.
- [x] **Tie or Slur?** — **shipped** (`tie_slur`, note_reading): read the curve —
  same pitch (tie, `NoteElement.tieToNext`) vs different pitch (slur,
  `Score.slurs`); a binary staff-read like Step or Skip?. SRI
  `reading.curve.<tie|slur>`.
- [x] **Beam or Flag?** — **shipped** (`beam_flag`, note_reading): read the two
  looks of eighths — joined by a beam (two eighths on one beat) vs each keeping
  its flag (eighths split by an eighth rest). A binary staff-read; the beam/flag
  contrast was verified at the crisp_notation layout level (same-beat eighths →
  1 beam; eighth-rest between → 0 beams). SRI `reading.beam.<beamed|flagged>`.

### D. Ear-training expansion (mic infra is shipped — exploit it)
- [x] **Sing/play the interval** — **shipped** (`sing_interval`, chords): two
  notes play (root→top), the interval's name is shown, and the child sings the
  TOP note back; the mic grades it octave-agnostic (pitch class), held briefly —
  reusing the `sing_back` capture harness. Third/fourth/fifth for beginners,
  second+sixth at 2★. SRI `intervals.sing.<name>` — the sung twin of Interval
  Ear. (Built on crisp_notation's `Interval` + `Pitch.transposeBy`.)
- [x] **Rhythm echo by tap** — **already shipped** as `rhythm_tap` (Notenwerte):
  a one-measure rhythm plays and is shown as notation, the child taps it back on
  a pad, and timing is graded onset-by-onset relative to the first tap (so the
  absolute start doesn't matter). SRI `note_values.rhythm.p<index>`. (Kept the
  onset-diff grader rather than the `beat_runner` falling-lane clock — for a
  call-and-response echo, comparing relative onsets is the right model.)
- [x] **Chord-quality-by-ear widening** — **done**: `major_minor_ear` widens from
  major/minor to a 4-way (adds **diminished + augmented** as a 2×2 grid) at 2★;
  below 2★ it stays the binary drill. The **dominant-7 tier** shipped as its own
  binary ear game — *Triad or Seventh?* (`triad_seventh`, chords): a major triad
  vs a dominant-7 (triad + a minor 7th), tap which. No 7th-chord *builder* was
  needed — the dom7 is built app-side from the major `Triad`'s pitches +
  `root.transposeBy(Interval.minorSeventh)`. SRI `chords.hear.<triad|seventh>`.

### E. Creative / toy modes (higher ceiling, higher effort)
- [x] **Loop mixer** — tap cards that trigger synced loops (bass/chords/melody/
  drums). **Shipped** as **Loop Mixer 2.0** (the groovebox ladder — GrooveSpec
  spec→WAV engine, seam-scheduled synced stems, sing-a-track, beatbox, graded jam
  mode). See the "Loop Mixer 2.0" roadmap section + HISTORY.md.
- [x] **Grid composer for pre-readers** — **shipped**: *Colour Melody*
  (`grid_composer`, composition) — a 5-colour (C-pentatonic) × 8-beat grid; taps
  place notes that render live to a real `Score` (StaffView underneath), and play
  back with rests intact (`playChordSequence`, empty beats = silence). A sandbox
  like My Melody (no stars). The bridge to notation for non-readers.
- [x] **Melody doodle → hear it back** — **shipped** (`melody_doodle`,
  composition): draw a contour → it quantises to the same C-pentatonic grid as
  *Colour Melody* and plays back. The gesture twin of `grid_composer`.

### F. Infrastructure / platform (not kid-facing games)
- [x] **Web-safe OMR-tokens import bridge** — **shipped** (2026-07-15): the
  Workshop ⋮ menu → **"Paste notation tokens…"** parses pasted **bekern** via
  `importBekern` = `MultiPartScore.fromStaffSystem(bekernToStaffSystem(text))`, so
  a multi-spine paste seeds one instrument part per spine (reuses the G6
  multi-part doc); a single spine loads into the active part. Pure helper
  unit-tested (1-/2-spine) + a widget test pastes tokens → notes. Localized
  de/en. (The image→tokens OMR recognition stays native/out-of-scope.)
- [~] **`showNoteNames` scaffold** — an accessibility/beginner toggle overlaying
  letter names on noteheads. **Unblocked** — crisp_notation now exposes
  `showNoteNames`/`noteNameStyle` on every multi-part view (`MultiSystemView`,
  `InteractiveMultiPartView`, `InteractiveGrandStaffView` in 0.4.2; the static
  `MultiPartView` in 0.4.4). The app-side toggle is **actively claimed** on the
  board (`opus (workshop-inspector)` — persisted `SettingsService.showNoteNames`
  + a `ReadingStaffView` wrapper wired into games where the note's name isn't the
  task). Still to decide there: how it reads the app's `noteNaming` setting
  (German H/B vs English vs Solfège).
- [x] **7th chords in Roman Numerals** — **shipped**: crisp_notation_core gained a
  `SeventhChord(root, ChordType, {inversion})` builder (0.4.5, `61266be`) and
  `roman_numeral_screen.dart` now mixes dominant/major/minor/ø7 chords into the
  widened pool at 2★ in major keys (`b439011`), round-tripping through
  `romanNumeralOf` (V7 / ii7 / viiø7 / V6/5).
- [x] **Leland / Leipzig font options** — **shipped** (`9d94d6f`): the binary
  "handwritten notes" toggle is now a 4-way **Notation font** picker (Bravura /
  Petaluma / Leland / Leipzig, all SIL OFL 1.1), vendored app-side under
  `assets/smufl/` with metadata + OFL. See `shared/score_theme.dart`
  (`ScoreFont`/`musicFontFor`) + `notation_fonts_test`.
- [ ] **MIDI input** — the one real-instrument input still open (mic side shipped).
  *L, big swing.*
- [ ] **Parent view + multi-child profiles** and **Teacher / LMS layer** — see the
  Opportunity backlog above; both are product-level, per-seat monetisable.

### G. Polish / cross-cutting (small, always welcome)
- [ ] New games should adopt the just-landed **per-game tutorial** hook on
  `GameInfo` and the **mascot-as-guide** in `RoundHeader` (UX agent's work — check
  `game_widgets.dart` for the current API before wiring). NB the on-demand "?"
  help is *already universal*: `helpPrimerFor` falls back to the game's module
  primer, and all 13 modules have one — so a missing `GameInfo.tutorial` only
  means no first-run auto-show, never an empty "?". This item is about the richer
  per-game curation + mascot, not basic coverage.
- [x] Audit the new games for the **sound on/off toggle** + **reduced-motion**
  paths — **audited 2026-07-17, all clean.** Sound: every playback path routes
  through `AudioService._play`, which no-ops when `soundOn` is false — no game
  bypasses it (only 1 game imports `synth` directly and it still goes via the
  service). Motion: no game uses a looping `.repeat()` animation; the only
  significant-motion screens (`note_whack`, `falling_notes`) plus the shared
  `note_mascot` already gate on `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`. Nothing to fix.
- [ ] Consider grouping the fast-growing `note_reading` module (it's large) or
  surfacing the new binary drills as a "Warm-ups" strip for the youngest.
