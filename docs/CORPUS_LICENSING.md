# Freely-licensed music corpora — sourcing & licence findings

Working notes for sourcing bundle-able ("Tier A") song/score/tab data for
CometBeat, a **COMMERCIAL** children's music app shipping in **Germany**.
**NOT legal advice.** Anything commercial-critical wants a Fachanwalt für
Urheberrecht sign-off (§3/§4 UrhG exposure + the axis-2 questions below).

Last updated 2026-07-22. Verified vs. pending is marked throughout. A **coverage
snapshot** — what is in hand vs what is still safely reachable — leads the doc;
source-by-source detail follows. (This is a *licensing/coverage* doc: it records
what each source **is** and whether it clears the two axes, not how any of it is
obtained.)

## The test every candidate must pass — TWO axes

A dataset qualifies for **shipping** only if BOTH are clean:

- **Axis 1 — the encoding/transcription licence.** CC0 / CC BY / MIT / ISC = ok;
  CC BY-NC / research-only / unstated = not. (CC BY-SA and the CPDL License are
  ok **but copyleft** — a bundle inherits share-alike.)
- **Axis 2 — the underlying work.** EU term is **life+70**, and for co-written
  works it runs from the **last surviving** author (Term Directive art. 1(6)).
  We ship in Germany, so **US public domain ("published before 1929") is NOT
  sufficient** — many US-PD sources are still protected in the EU.

A CC0 transcription of an in-copyright song is **axis-1 clean, axis-2 fail** —
that split is the trap that sinks most candidates. The two clean shapes are:
(a) a permissive transcription of a **long-PD** work, or (b) audio/notation
**created for the dataset itself** (no third-party work underneath).

## Our import reach — format is rarely the blocker; LICENCE is

App import filters (verified in code, `import_screen.dart` /
`composition_workshop_screen.dart` / `tab_workshop_screen.dart`):

| Format | ext | into |
|---|---|---|
| MusicXML (+zip) | musicxml / xml / mxl | full Score |
| MIDI | mid / midi | full Score |
| ABC | abc | full Score |
| MEI | mei | full Score |
| **Humdrum kern** | krn | full Score (rare in consumer apps — our edge) |
| MuseScore | mscx / mscz | full Score |
| Guitar Pro (GPIF) | gp / gpx | full Score + **tab** |
| ChordPro | cho / pro | chord sheet |
| JAMS | jams | chords + melody |
| ASCII tab | (text) | tab Score |

In-library but **not UI-wired**: `scoreFromSemantic`, `scoreFromLilyNotes` — the
cheapest possible "new filters" (parser exists, only wiring missing). But note
their poster-child corpus (PrIMuS) is licence-blocked, so wire them only when a
cleanly-licensed source in those encodings turns up.

## Two strategic findings

**TABS: don't source them — generate them.** Every large Guitar-Pro corpus is a
scrape of in-copyright songs (DadaGP, ~26k, research-access-only, from Ultimate
Guitar — both axes dirty). BUT we own `arrangeTab` + `gpFretPlanFor` +
`scoreToGpif` + the `tabconv` CLI: we **manufacture playable tab from any
score**. So the tab corpus == the clean score corpus run through our arranger.
Zero third-party tab licensing needed.

**The academic classical corpora are a NonCommercial trap.** The "obvious"
symbolic-classical route (kern/ABC editions of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven) is
almost uniformly CC BY-NC-SA — axis-2 clean, axis-1 fail. Verified across 8
repos below. Reachable, but dev/test only.

## Coverage snapshot (2026-07-22) — what we hold vs what is still reachable

The direct answer to "what have we covered / what could we still safely add."
Every line here is a *licence/coverage* statement; detail per source follows.

### Covered now — assessed, licence-cleared, in hand

- **Unified shippable score corpus — 16,800 scores, 8 sources, both axes clean**
  (`music-db/db.json`): PDMX CC0-original 7,471 · NIFC Polish (life+70-filtered)
  6,720 · OpenScore Lieder (composer+poet death-checked) 1,350 · NIFC Chopin 512 ·
  OpenScore String Quartets 122 · OpenEWLD-eu-pd 103 · Mutopia 510 · EGSet12 12.
  Licences: CC0 / CC BY / MIT / PD (per source), each filtered on axis 2. Held
  in multiple formats (midi/mxl/pdf/json/mscx/mscz/ly).
- **Tabs for every one of those scores come free** via our own `arrangeTab` — the
  shippable *tab* corpus **is** this score corpus, no third-party tab licensing.
- **JAMS Tier-A** (`jams-corpus/tierA`): GuitarSet 360 (CC BY) · Harmonix 912 (MIT)
  · jams-pkg 7 (ISC) · OpenEWLD-eu-pd 103 (MIT).
- **Tab-pipeline data, assessed:** GuitarSet + EGSet12 (both-axes clean, real
  string/fret) shippable; Guitar-TECHS + AG-PT-set (CC BY) trainable for audio→tab;
  GAPS / IDMT (NC) eval-only.
- **IMSLP — "Marieh" CC0 guitar transcriptions: 235 tablature + 259 standard-notation
  PDFs.** Axis 1 = explicit **CC0** dedication by the arranger; axis 2 = PD 19th-c.
  composers (Giuliani d.1829, Viñas d.1888, Sor, …) → **both axes clean.** Dual
  value: (a) real-world PDF **OMR test input**, (b) clean guitar score/tab material.
  A per-work composer death-check stays prudent (as for any PD claim), but this is
  the cleanest guitar-tab-of-PD-works source found.

### Safely reachable next — clean, identified, not yet ingested

- **OpenScore Lieder — the rest of the CC0 set** beyond the 1,350 shipped, as the
  composer+poet death-filter clears further pairs. Highest-value clean growth.
- **NIFC Polish — the 1,860 undated-anonymous manuscripts currently HELD**, if a
  provenance/RISM date pass can establish pre-1955 publication (fail-closed today).
- **Self-engraved German Kinderlieder** from pre-1900 PD facsimiles (Erk/Böhme
  *Deutscher Liederhort*, Zuccalmaglio) — the only clean route to the German
  children's repertoire the app wants; sidesteps every third-party encoding/DB claim.
- **GregoBase** (CC0 Gregorian chant) — axis 2 trivially clear; needs a GABC→MusicXML
  step. **CPDL / ChoralWiki** (CPDL License = commercial + share-alike, copyleft) —
  strong for a singing app; per-edition axis-2 filter.
- **Fingered layers:** Burgmüller Op.100 (PD, fingered) + NIFC Chopin `**fing`
  spines (CC BY, PD fingering); and **dead-editor PD scans** via a vision/OMR pass —
  recovers notes + authentic period fingerings owned outright (guitar/cello solution).
- **Broader IMSLP CC0** — other CC0-dedicating arrangers beyond "Marieh", same
  two-axis test applied per work.

### Not reachable (settled — see the rejected tables)

Academic classical kern/ABC (craigsapp, DCML, JRP, Essen, Meertens — NC); all large
Guitar Pro archives (DadaGP / UG scrapes — research-only + in-copyright); thesession
(ODbL + anti-LLM); German folk-song sites (private/all-rights-reserved); GOAT / GAPS /
IDMT tab-training (NC/ND → eval-only). PrIMuS / RISM MEI (unstated licence).

## VERIFIED — shippable (Tier A)

All licences below read verbatim from the source's own LICENSE file / legal page
(or, for PDMX, its metadata), this effort.

### Already downloaded, on the VPS (`/mnt/volume1/jams-corpus/tierA`)

| Dataset | Files | Axis 1 | Axis 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| GuitarSet | 360 jams | CC BY 4.0 (Zenodo API) | recorded FOR the dataset — nothing underneath ✅ |
| Harmonix | 912 jams | MIT | beat/segment timestamps only ✅ |
| jams-pkg | 7 jams | ISC | synthetic ✅ |
| OpenEWLD-eu-pd | 87 works / 103 mxl | MIT | author-death filtered to EU-PD ✅ (defensible, not "cleared") |

### music-db integration status (2026-07-22) — 16,800 entries

`/mnt/volume1/music-db/db.json` now indexes **16,800 scores** across 8 sources,
each with a multi-format `files{}` map. By source: PDMX 7,471 · **NIFC Polish
Scores 6,720** · OpenScore Lieder 1,350 · NIFC Chopin 512 · OpenScore SQ 122 ·
OpenEWLD 103 · Mutopia 510 · EGSet12 12.

- **NIFC Polish Scores** (2026-07-22): `git clone`d the 8,918-krn repo. Verified
  axis-2 from the **authoritative `!!!CDT` composer-date headers** (source metadata,
  beats Wikidata — and corrected Wikidata's namesake false-positives) AND
  parseability. Ships iff parseable AND (composer CDT latest year ≤1955, OR
  anonymous **with a pre-1955 source/publication date**). Result: **SHIPPED 6,720**
  (PD-composer 6,158 + dated-anonymous 562); **HELD 2,173** = undated-anonymous
  1,860 + undated-composer 289 + unparseable 24; **DROPPED 25** (dated >1955, e.g.
  S. Kazuro d.1961). CC BY 4.0 → attribution.
  - ⚠ **Anonymous ≠ automatically PD** (EU: anon = 70y from *publication*). So the
    **1,860 undated-anonymous manuscripts are HELD**, not shipped — historical-looking
    (NIFC archives, mostly 16th–19th c by SMS-siglum) but not *provably* pre-1955.
    A provenance/RISM date pass could clear many (`polish_held.json`).
  - **Parseability sweep** (our own reader, run **on the VPS** via
    `/mnt/volume1/toolchain/flutter/bin/dart` + a `crisp_notation` clone): **8,894 /
    8,918 = 99.73% parse**; the 24 failures (malformed edge tokens) are held.
  - Tooling: `tool/music_db_ingest_polish.py`, `music_db_polish_cdt_classify.py`,
    `music_db_krn_parse_sweep.dart`.
- **OpenScore quarantine applied**: the 2 genuine in-copyright poet cases (Erich
  Jansen d.1968, Bruce Blunt d.1957) removed via `os_exclude.json` (merge skips
  them); the other 11 flagged were Wikidata namesake false-positives, kept. Lieder
  1,352 → 1,350.
- **kern parser quality-checked** (music21 oracle + Dart self-roundtrip over the
  real Chopin/Polish corpus): **found + fixed a reader crash** on breve/long/maxima
  durations (`00`/`000`) — 10% of a polish sample failed before, **60/60 parse
  after** (crisp_notation `d4655e7`). Two findings recorded: **music21 is an
  unreliable oracle for early-music kern** (it `ExpanderException`s on repeats and
  drops the majority of notes on multi-spine masses — our reader reads them more
  completely, matching raw token density); and our **kern *writer* is lossy for
  dense multi-voice** (single spine per part → drops voices 2-4), which doesn't
  affect the DB (we ship original krn, the reader is what the app uses).

- **Added this session:** **OpenEWLD** (103 mxl, MIT, author-death-filtered EU-PD,
  `tool/music_db_ingest_openewld.py`) · **NIFC Chopin First Editions** (512 krn, CC
  BY 4.0, Chopin d.1849 = PD + PD first-edition fingering; `music_db_ingest_nifc.py`)
  · **EGSet12** (12 `.gp`, CC BY 4.0, original by the dataset authors;
  `music_db_ingest_egset12.py`). CC BY entries carry attribution → `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
- **OpenScore axis-2 VERIFIED** (was "assumed"): a composer+**poet** life+70 Wikidata
  check (`tool/music_db_openscore_life70.py`) over 661 unique names → **1,461/1,474
  CLEAR, 13 BLOCKED** (`os_problematic.json`). Most of the 13 are Wikidata **namesake
  false-positives** (Glinka d.1857 matched a 1936-2022 person; "John Howard Payne"
  d.1852 → a 1912-1989 "John Payne"; "A. S." → novelist A.S. Byatt) — only ~2 look
  genuine, both **poets/lyricists** (Erich Jansen d.1968, Bruce Blunt d.1957). Pending
  a targeted quarantine of the genuine cases.
- **HELD (not added):** **humdrum-polish-scores** — turns out to be **8,918 krn**
  (not a small companion); CC BY on axis-1 but composers not all PD → needs the same
  life+70 pass before shipping. **GregoBase** — its `download.php` is an HTML page;
  the GABC bulk export needs a GABC→MusicXML converter we don't have. **CPDL** —
  copyleft + per-edition axis-2 filter, a separate project.

### New, verified-clean, format-reachable (no new code needed)

| Source | →reach | Axis 1 | Notes / axis-2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenScore Lieder** | MusicXML | **CC0** (LICENSE.txt) | 1,200+ 19th-c. art songs, multi-part + lyrics. **Top pick.** Needs composer+poet death-filter (below). |
| **OpenScore String Quartets** | MusicXML | **CC0** (LICENSE.txt) | Chamber, PD composers. Smaller, same clean profile. |
| **PDMX** (is_original slice) | MusicXML→**MIDI built** | **CC0**, 7,547 MIDIs ✅ | Original amateur compositions. Self-attested → wants a dup pass. MIDIs converted + roundtrip-verified (see below). |
| **Mutopia** | .ly / MIDI | **CC BY-SA / CC BY / PD — all commercial-OK** (legal.html) | Per-piece licence + editor-rights filter; BY-SA copyleft on a bundle. |
| **CPDL / ChoralWiki** | MusicXML/MXL where offered | **CPDL License = commercial + share-alike** (copyleft); editions also CC / PD | Choral/vocal — strong for a SINGING app. Per-edition filter; §3 engraving + US-PD cautions. |
| **GregoBase** | GABC (needs converter) or its MusicXML export | **CC0** | Gregorian chant; axis-2 trivially clear. Niche for kids. |
| **IMSLP "Marieh" guitar transcriptions** | PDF (tab + notation) | **CC0** (arranger's explicit dedication) | 235 tablature + 259 standard-notation PDFs; underlying composers PD 19th-c. (Giuliani d.1829, Viñas d.1888, Sor…) → both axes clean. Dual use: **OMR test input** + clean guitar score/tab. Per-work composer death-check prudent. |

**Detail worth keeping:**

- **PDMX** — **254,077** MuseScore scores (the superset; `subset:all`). The headline
  "public domain" is mostly the **PD Mark** (210,364) — a *claim*, not a grant. Only
  **43,713** are real **CC0** (`cc-zero`). CC0 covers the ENGRAVING only: the
  clean-CC0 set still contains "Seven Nation Army", "Light of the Seven", "Crimson
  Peak – Edith's Theme" (in-copyright songs, axis-2 fail). The `is_original` flag is
  the axis-2 filter. Other named subsets in the current HF CSV: `subset:rated` 14,182,
  `subset:deduplicated` 102,635, `subset:rated_deduplicated` 13,187 (there is **no**
  `subset:no_license_conflict` column in this release, though the README recommends
  one). Counts verified directly from the tarball's `PDMX.csv` (2026-07-21).
  - **Our clean slice → 7,547 CC0-original MIDIs built + validated** at
    **`/mnt/volume1/pdmx-cc0-midi/mid/`** (2026-07-21). Filter = `cc-zero ∧
    is_original ∧ no license_conflict`. NB the **current** HF CSV dropped the
    `license_conflict` column, so in it `cc-zero ∧ is_original = 9,744`; our 7,547 is
    that **minus 2,197** conflict-flagged rows (7,547 + 2,197 = 9,744) — the safe,
    conservative subset. All 7,547 re-confirmed `cc-zero ∧ is_original` against the
    current CSV (0 misclassified). (Source list `pdmx_cc0_mid.txt` had 7,549 rows /
    7,548 unique basenames, one a null `NA` → 7,547 real scores; all converted, 0
    skipped, 1 out-of-range pitch clamped across 9.78M notes.)
  - **PDMX ships JSON-only** on HuggingFace: `openmusic/pdmx` is a single 1.59 GB
    `PDMX.tar.gz` = 508k `.json` (254k score `data/` + 254k `metadata/`), **0
    `.mid`/`.mxl`/`.pdf`**. This release's CSV has `path`(=json)/`metadata` columns
    and **no `mid`/`mxl` columns at all** — the phantom `mid/`/`mxl/` paths came from
    an older/Zenodo CSV. The name "Public Domain **MusicXML**" is provenance (scraped
    as MusicXML from MuseScore); the fuller **Zenodo** release (`zenodo.15571083`)
    adds "MXL, PDF, MID when available". MusicXML/MIDI are **derivable** from the JSON
    (muspy → music21) if ever wanted.
  - **Validation — is the conversion perfect? vs the authoritative ground truth
    (muspy, the lib PDMX was built with, and beneath it the source JSON note list):**
    (a) full-corpus roundtrip (our own independent MIDI parser vs source JSON):
    **7,547/7,547 perfect, 9,778,989/9,778,989 note-ons = 100.0000%**; (b) vs muspy's
    own object on samples: **pitch+onset 100.0000%**; (c) mine vs muspy's own `.mid`,
    apples-to-apples incl. duration: **99.9997%** (298/299 perfect, 300-file sample).
    The residual is **muspy dropping notes**, not us: across the sample **mine = JSON
    exactly (377,636 note-ons, Δ0)** while **muspy wrote 377,239 (Δ−397)** and crashed
    outright on 1 file (a `♭`/U+266D track name → latin-1 error). Mechanism = muspy's
    writer collapses **same-pitch temporally-overlapping notes**; our writer preserves
    every note. Caveat (MIDI format limit, not a bug): overlapping same-pitch notes
    can't have their paired durations uniquely recovered on read-back — pitch+onset is
    exact, counts are exact, only such overlaps' durations are ambiguous (true of every
    writer, muspy included). **Net: our converter is at least as faithful as muspy and
    strictly more note-preserving.**
  - Converter + validator: `tool/pdmx_json_to_midi.py` (stdlib-only,
    `extract`/`convert`/`validate`/`all`). MIDIs derived from CC0 source →
    redistributable; still self-attested on axis-2, so a dup/plagiarism pass is wise
    before shipping.
  - **In-app Dart importer** (2026-07-21): `crisp_notation_core`'s
    `musicrender_reader.dart` reads muspy/PDMX JSON into the notation model —
    `musicRenderToMidi` (note-exact JSON→SMF, the Dart twin of muspy's write_midi),
    `multiPartScoreFromMusicRender`, `scoreFromMusicRender`. Surfaced via
    `bin/musicrenderconv.dart` (CLI) and the Song Book import screen (`.json`).
    Cross-validated on the corpus: Dart `musicRenderToMidi` = the Python converter
    **100%**, = muspy **99.9997%** (residual = muspy's note-drops). This doubles as a
    pipeline oracle (muspy JSON → our importer → our MIDI/MXL vs PDMX's own MID/MXL).
  - **Integrated into the music DB** (`/mnt/volume1/music-db/`, 2026-07-21): the
    7,547 clean MIDIs are a new **`PDMX`** source in `db.json` (now 9,531 items:
    Mutopia 510 + OpenScore Lieder 1,352 + String Quartets 122 + **PDMX 7,547**),
    ingested via `tool/pdmx_ingest_music_db.py` (→ `bin/ingest_pdmx.py` on the VPS)
    and merged with `bin/merge_db.py`. Files at `music-db/pdmx/ship/midi/<hash>.mid`;
    metadata (title, uploader, GM-program-derived instruments) from `PDMX.csv`.
    Each entry is `rights_status: CC0` but `rights_method` marks it **self-attested,
    UNVERIFIED** and kept as a distinct `source` so it never mixes with the
    hand-verified core, adds **0** attribution obligations. ⚠ **Axis-2 caveat is
    real and large:** `is_original` is unreliable — **55.3% (4,174/7,547) name a
    third-party composer ≠ the uploader** (e.g. "Crimson Peak – Edith's Theme" /
    Fernando Velázquez, Bert Appermont, "Arranged by…"). That count over-estimates
    (some are same-person username mismatches or PD composers like Satie), but a
    proper dedup/originality pass is warranted before treating PDMX as clean-original.
  - **Originality pass done + quarantine applied** (2026-07-21): a Wikidata life+70
    check (reusing `bin/eu_pd_check.py`'s logic, extended to flag *living*
    composers) over the 2,245 unique third-party composer names split them: **~3,357
    demonstrably clean** (PD composer d≤1955 → CC0 engraving of a PD work; or a
    placeholder like "Composer"; or an amateur that resolves to no notable composer),
    **~741 unresolvable/odd** (low-risk), and **76 that name a real in-copyright
    composer** — the actionable residual (jazz standards: Ellington/Garner/Goodman;
    film/game/pop: Rodgers, Denver, Ed Sheeran, Einaudi, Koji Kondo, Santaolalla…;
    plus a ~29-entry "James Brown" Wikidata **namesake false-positive** — an amateur
    band arranger, though those titles are pop covers so risky anyway). All **76 were
    quarantined**: `pdmx_exclude.json` (the ingest now skips them), MIDIs moved to
    `pdmx/quarantine/midi/`, record in `pdmx_quarantine.json`. **PDMX 7,547 → 7,471**
    in `db.json` (total 9,455). Tooling: `tool/pdmx_originality_classify.py` +
    `tool/pdmx_originality_report.py`. NB this catches only *named* copyrighted
    composers; works hiding under a blank/amateur composer field (recognisable by
    TITLE — "Hallelujah", "Perfect") would need a separate title-based scan.
  - **Multi-format `files` map** (2026-07-21): every `db.json` entry carries a
    `files` object of format→relative-path, added by `bin/enrich_files.py`
    (`tool/pdmx_music_db_enrich_files.py`) as the final pipeline step after
    `merge_db.py`. PDMX carries all four (midi/mxl/json/pdf — the big json/pdf/mxl
    are relative **dir-symlinks** `pdmx/ship/{mxl,json,pdf}` → the cache, not copied).
  - **Overnight format enrichment DONE** (2026-07-22, `bin/overnight.sh`, ~18 min, 0
    failures): (1) fetched **Mutopia PDF (505) + LilyPond `.ly` (442)** from the FTP
    dirs → `mutopia/ship/<cat>/{pdf,ly}/`; (2) derived **MIDI for all 1,352 OpenScore**
    scores from their `.mxl` via a pure-stdlib MusicXML→MIDI (`tool/music_db_mxl_to_midi.py`,
    validated 40/40, note-ons 1.0007× expected). Final availability across 9,455
    entries: **midi 9,333 · mxl 8,823 · pdf 7,976 · json 7,471 · mscx 1,474 · mscz
    1,352 · ly 442**; formats-per-entry: 4→8,823, 3→440, 2→67, **1→125** (the 122
    String Quartets, mscx-only, + 3 Mutopia lacking pdf/ly).
  - **What could NOT be fetched from the web:** the **OpenScore StringQuartets repo
    ships `.mscx` only** (no mxl/mscz on GitHub — verified via the API), and
    musescore.com MIDI/PDF are Pro-gated; so the 122 SQ stay mscx-only until derived
    Dart-side (crisp_notation `scoreFromMscx`→`scoreToMidi`, off-VPS).
  - **Full Zenodo release cached** (`zenodo.15571083`, 2026-07-21) on the VPS at
    `/mnt/volume1/pdmx-cc0-midi/zenodo/`: `mid.tar.gz` (254,035 official MIDIs),
    `mxl.tar.gz` (MusicXML), `pdf.tar.gz` (9 GB sheet-music PDFs), full `PDMX.csv`
    (215 MB, with mid/mxl/pdf path columns), `subset_paths.tar.gz`. Their `.mid`/
    `.mxl`/`.pdf` use the same `Qm…`-hash basenames. The **7,547 clean subset** is
    extracted per-format under `zenodo/{mid_official,mxl,pdf}/`. NB their official
    `.mid` are muspy-written → carry the same same-pitch-overlap note-drops; our
    built MIDIs are more faithful.
- **Mutopia** — all three licences permit commercial use. Native guitar `.ly`
  files are mixed: e.g. Aguado Op. 11 No. 6 (`Mutopia-2016/01/15-2097`, CC BY-SA
  4.0, plate-backed to S. Richault 6713.R.) carries sparse editor cues (one
  explicit LilyPond string event `\2`, some left-hand fingerings) and its
  `TabStaff` is commented out ("tabs are not completely developed"). Treat as
  clean score material + sparse string cues, not full tab gold. For our tab
  labeler, LilyPond string-number events (`\1`..`\6`) are the useful labels:
  fret is derivable from note pitch + string. Left-hand finger numbers are only
  auxiliary context.
  Automated scan: `tool/mutopia_guitar_scan.py` against local
  `/Users/christianstrobele/code/mutopia-guitar/manifest.json` downloaded 361
  primary `.ly` sources from 388 guitar entries; 27 derived source URLs were 404.
  Classification: 6 `dense_string_labels`, 20 `weak_string_labels`, 21
  `sparse_string_labels`, 36 `fingering_only`, 84 `tabstaff_score_only`, 194
  `score_only`, 27 `unscanned`. Strongest direct
  string-label candidates are `capricho-arabe` (229 string events),
  `moonlight-guitar-duo` (90), `sym5-1-guitar-duo` (79),
  `wtk1-prelude1-guitar-duo` (73), `claro-de-luna` (69), and
  `sorf_op35_no22` (65). Reports:
  `/Users/christianstrobele/code/mutopia-guitar/reports/mutopia_guitar_ly_scan.{json,csv}`.
  Conclusion: useful, but not GuitarSet-scale gold. Use dense files as direct
  string/fret supervision, weak/sparse string files as lower-weight supervision,
  and score-only pieces for arranger-generated pseudo-label pretraining before
  GuitarSet fine-tuning.

Tabs for **every** row above come free via our own `arrangeTab` — see the tab
finding. So the shippable *tab* corpus is exactly this shippable *score* corpus.

## Tab pipeline — datasets to IMPROVE it (symbolic→tab, audio→tab)

Different goal from bundling: training/eval data to make the tab pipeline
better, not content to ship. Licence logic shifts slightly — for a model shipped
in a commercial app, **CC BY / CC0 = trainable; CC BY-NC = eval/dev only; ND =
can't even derive.** Axis 2 is usually clean here because the audio is recorded
**for** the dataset (no third-party song underneath) — GAPS is the exception
(YouTube-linked real performances).

**The highest-value "improve" move needs no new data — it re-uses GuitarSet as a
BENCHMARK for our arranger.** Every note in GuitarSet's JAMS carries the
string+fret a real guitarist chose. Extract (pitch-sequence → human string/fret),
run our own `arrangeTab` on the same pitches, and measure agreement + playability.
That turns GuitarSet (CC BY 4.0, already on the VPS) from "content" into a
quantified quality metric + regression benchmark for symbolic→tab — the "improve,
not just use" the arranger currently lacks (it has a cost model, no ground truth).

### Datasets (verified via Zenodo API this session)

| Dataset | Zenodo | Licence | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GuitarSet** | 3371780 | **CC BY 4.0** | GOLD. `.jams` w/ note+string+fret ground truth → arranger benchmark AND audio→tab train. Have it. |
| **EGSet12** | 11406378 | **CC BY 4.0** | **`.gp` + `.jams`**, 12 solo electric pieces, **original — composed by the author** (axis-2 clean). Tiny (~6 min) but BOTH-axes clean, both formats we import, real string/fret. ✅ shippable + trainable |
| **Guitar-TECHS** | 14963133 | **CC BY 4.0** (4.1 GB) | electric; techniques + excerpts + chords + scales, diverse hardware. audio→tab + technique. ✅ trainable |
| **AG-PT-set** | 10159492 | **CC BY 4.0** (6.7 GB) | acoustic; 12 playing techniques, onset-labeled (10h). technique detection. ✅ trainable |

| **ToqueFlamenco** | 804050 | **CC BY 4.0** | flamenco falsetas + MIDI manual transcriptions. ✅ |
| **GAPS (Guitar-Aligned Performance Scores)** | 17152440 | **CC BY-NC-SA** | aligned MIDI + scores + downbeats; THE audio→score set. ❌ NC → eval/dev only, not the shipped model |
| **IDMT-SMT-Guitar** | 7544110 | **CC BY-NC-ND** | classic transcription set; NC **and** ND → ❌ dev/test only |

**For the audio→tab effort** (another agent is on a TabCNN/OMR path — see
`tabcnn_emitter.dart`, `audiveris/`): the CC-BY training expansion of the
GuitarSet-only TabCNN is **Guitar-TECHS + AG-PT-set**. **Do NOT train the
shipped model on GAPS or IDMT-SMT-Guitar** (NC) — use them only to evaluate.

**Fingering (left-hand finger 1–4), not just fret:** GuitarSet gives string+fret
(→ position), from which fingering can be *derived* but is not labelled. No clean
CC-BY explicit-fingering guitar corpus surfaced this pass — flag as a data gap if
the arranger is to output finger numbers, not just frets.

### String/fret ground-truth by FORMAT (the user's question, answered)

Where clean (both-axes) explicit string/fret supervision actually lives, per
format we import. The useful label is **string number** — given pitch + string,
fret is deterministic; left-hand fingering is only auxiliary.

- **`.jams`** — **GuitarSet** (large, CC BY, string+fret) + **EGSet12** (12,
  CC BY, string/fret via its paired `.gp`). That is essentially the entire
  clean JAMS-with-string/fret universe — JAMS guitar annotation is rare, and
  everything else that surfaced was effects/tone (GUITAR-FX, EGFxSet) with no
  fret data, or NC (IDMT).
- **`.gp` (Guitar Pro)** — `.gp` encodes string+fret inherently, but every large
  archive is a UG scrape of in-copyright songs (DadaGP, research-only). The ONLY
  both-axes-clean `.gp` found is **EGSet12** (12 original pieces). So clean `.gp`
  data = EGSet12 + whatever **we generate ourselves** via `scoreToGpif`.
- **`.ly` (LilyPond)** — **Mutopia**, scanned by `tool/mutopia_guitar_scan.py`:
  **47 files with explicit LilyPond string events (`\1`..`\6`), 1,117 events
  total** (6 dense / 20 weak / 21 sparse); densest `capricho-arabe` (229),
  `moonlight-guitar-duo` (90). The 36 `fingering_only` files are NOT string/fret
  labels. This is the main `.ly` string-label source; useful but not
  GuitarSet-scale — dense files as direct supervision, weak/sparse as
  lower-weight, score-only as arranger-pseudo-label pretraining.
- **`.mei`** — **GAP.** MEI's `<tabGrp>` module encodes string+fret+finger
  natively and historical lute/guitar tab is long-PD, but **no accessible CC0/
  CC-BY MEI-tablature *data* corpus surfaced** (the TabMEI org is empty; the lute
  repos found are editors/converters, e.g. ECOLM's `ecolmeditor` (GPL code), not
  licensed encoded corpora). Historical lute tab is also 6-course, non-guitar
  tuning — marginal for a guitar app even if a corpus turned up. Treat `.mei`
  string/fret as not-currently-available rather than promising.

**Net:** the clean string/fret world is small and concentrated — GuitarSet
(`.jams`, the anchor) + EGSet12 (`.gp`+`.jams`) + Mutopia's 47 `.ly` files. This
is *exactly* why the "generate tabs from clean scores via `arrangeTab`" strategy
matters: sourced ground truth alone won't scale a fret/fingering model.

### Tab-labeler model — SHIPPED, and how this corpus work feeds it

The symbolic→tab labeler is built and published: `cstr/tab-labeler-onnx` (HF),
trainer at `onnx_runtime_dart/tool/tab_labeler/{extract,train}.py`, acceptance
gate `test/tab_labeler_accept_test.dart`. It's the "improve the arranger"
direction, done: a tiny CNN scores `(string,fret)` placements so `arrangeTab`'s
Viterbi fingers like a human. Same `[6,21]` contract as the audio→tab TabCNN, so
the shipped decoder consumes both.

**Licence provenance — verified clean.** Trained **only on GuitarSet (CC BY 4.0)**
(`extract.py` reads GuitarSet JAMS; val held out on player 05). HF card is
`license: cc-by-4.0` and attributes GuitarSet verbatim (*"Trained on GuitarSet
(Xi et al., ISMIR 2018, CC BY 4.0) — derived weights redistributable with
attribution. No DadaGP / no request-gated data."*). So the shipped model is
commercial-clean **provided the app carries the GuitarSet attribution** (add it
to the About/licenses registry alongside Bravura OFL).

**Measured result (my run of the promoted `8270` model, 60 held-out songs /
8,715 positions):** human-fingering agreement **56.98% (heuristic) → 82.70%
(model), +25.71 pts**, at ~equal hand movement. The model never emits tab — it
only scores positions the arranger enumerates, so playability invariants hold.

⚠ **Stale model card:** the HF card documents **78.59% (+21.6 pts)** — an earlier
model. The promoted weights (`8270`) now measure **82.70% (+25.71 pts)**. Update
the card, and confirm which weights are actually live on HF (there's a local
`hf-upload-8270` dir).

**How the corpus findings extend it (clean training expansion):**
- **EGSet12** (CC BY 4.0, `.jams`+`.gp`, original) — new clean per-string data
  beyond GuitarSet's 6 players. Tiny, but adds a 7th player/style at zero licence
  cost. Fold into `extract.py`'s GuitarSet glob.
- **Mutopia `.ly`, `non-sa/` only** — the 47 string-labeled files (`tool/
  mutopia_guitar_scan.py`) are **sparse PARTIAL string PINS, not dense per-note
  labels** (guitar staff notation can't carry full string/fret — string marks on
  <½ the notes even at densest). Role: `Score.tabVoicings` pins + arranger
  pseudo-labels, NOT a GuitarSet-grade training set. And the **CC BY-SA subset is
  copyleft** — only `non-sa/` (CC BY / PD) may feed a CC-BY model. See
  `docs/TAB_LABELER_ROADMAP.md` §3 for the dense-vs-sparse data picture.
- **Guitar-TECHS / AG-PT-set (CC BY)** — for the *audio*→tab TabCNN, not this
  symbolic labeler.

### Movement is a TUNABLE knob, not a model property — measured Pareto frontier

The `8270` model raised human-fingering agreement to 82.70% but at **+6.8% hand
movement** vs the heuristic (the `7859` model was +25→+21.6 pts at +3.4%). That
extra movement is NOT baked into the weights: `arrangeTab` is already a Viterbi
DP whose transition term penalises hand travel (`|Δfret|·cost.move`, default
1.0) — the model only replaces the *local* term, so its idiomatic-position
preference just outvotes `cost.move`. Raising that one weight claws movement
back, measured on the 60-song / 8,715-position benchmark (8270 model):

| `cost.move` | agreement | movement | vs heuristic mvmt |
|---|---|---|---|
| heuristic (no model) | 56.98% | 4095 | — |
| 1.0 (shipped) | **82.70%** | 4372 | +6.8% |
| 1.5 | 81.66% | 4251 | +3.8% |
| **2.0 (knee)** | **80.38%** | **4147** | **+1.3%** |
| 3.0 | 79.00% | 4086 | −0.2% |
| 6.0 | 77.06% | 4078 | −0.4% |

**`move≈2.0` keeps 80.4% agreement at near-heuristic movement**, and
**8270@move-2.0 (80.4% / +1.3%) dominates 7859@move-1.0 (78.6% / +3.4%) on both
axes** — so ship 8270 with a higher `cost.move`, archive 7859 as a dominated
fallback. This is a bog-standard result: string-instrument fingering as a
min-cost path over hand-position states is the **Sayegh (1989) "optimum path
paradigm"**, extended by Radicioni & Lombardo, Radisavljevic & Driessen (2004,
learned costs), Barbancho et al. (2012, HMM w/ fingering-difficulty transitions),
and Heijink & Meulenbroek (2002, biomechanical cost). Our emission-model + DP-
transition stack is exactly that family; the model supplies local idiomaticity,
the DP enforces low movement/span globally.

**One caveat — span vs movement differ.** Raising `cost.move` fixes *movement*
(a transition cost). It does NOT bias toward smaller *spans*, because the model
**replaces** the local term where `cost.span` lived — so within the hard span cap
(`kHandSpan=5`) the model picks the shape. To also prefer *narrower* shapes, the
one code change worth making is to keep `cost.span`/`cost.height` in the local
cost **additively** even when the model is present (`local = −modelScore·w +
_localCost(f)`), rather than replacing it. Small, in `arrangeTab`'s `local()`.

## Still unverified

- **RISM open data** — the layer *under* PrIMuS; a possible MEI unlock if its
  incipits carry a clean CC licence. Could NOT verify: rism.online is a JS SPA
  that returns an empty shell to fetchers and hangs on curl; the static
  open-data pages 404. Widely *reputed* CC0, but unconfirmed — do NOT rely on
  memory. **Low priority** anyway: incipits are short fragments, less useful
  than full scores, and the PrIMuS route is licence-blocked regardless.

  liederenbank.nl — *"Meertens Tune Collections by Meertens Instituut is licensed

## The recurring German-law point (from multiple sources, incl. the sites themselves)

Even for a PD tune, a **modern Notensatz / arrangement carries its own fresh
copyright** (§3 UrhG), and a curated collection carries a **database right**
(§4 / §87a-e UrhG). "gemeinfrei" / "GEMA-frei" ≠ "free to bundle". **Lyrics
clear separately** from melody and often later. This is why OpenScore Lieder
needs a composer-**and**-poet death check, and why CPDL/Mutopia need a per-item
filter that also considers the modern editor.

## Recommended next actions (when limits + VPS return)

1. **OpenScore Lieder, death-date filtered** — reuse the OpenEWLD Wikidata filter
   on **both** composer and poet (a sampled 8 Lieder poets all died pre-1948:
   Campbell 1914, Coleridge 1907, Crewe-Milnes 1945, Davidson 1909, Evers 1947,
   Eschelbach 1948, Falke 1916, Fallström 1937 — encouraging, but a sample).
   Highest-value clean growth: CC0 + filterable + real repertoire with lyrics.
2. **PDMX is_original slice** — fetch the 7,549, add a dup/plagiarism pass.
3. **Self-engrave German Kinderlieder** from pre-1900 PD facsimiles (Erk/Böhme
   *Deutscher Liederhort*, Zuccalmaglio) into our own MusicXML via crisp_notation
   — sidesteps every third-party encoding/DB claim, and is the only clean route
   to the German children's-song repertoire the app actually wants.
4. Fetch the CC-BY tab-training sets (Guitar-TECHS 14963133, AG-PT-set 10159492)
   and build the GuitarSet arranger-benchmark (see tab-pipeline section).
5. rsync the corpus off `/mnt/volume1` (VPS-local, not backed up) to
   `/mnt/storage`.

## Preserving fingering/fret/bowing — the performance layer (2026-07-21)

Regenerating fingering algorithmically loses the human choice, so sources that
*retain* it are worth more. Structural finding across a five-instrument sweep:
**no openly-licensed corpus is simultaneously (a) at scale, (b) clean for a
commercial EU/German ship, and (c) carries a real string/fret/finger/bow layer.**
The layer must be **authored, or taken from a dead-editor source**, never
harvested from a modern edition.

### Sources that DO carry fingering and are shippable
- **NIFC Chopin First Editions** — `github.com/pl-wnifc/humdrum-chopin-first-editions`,
  **CC BY 4.0** (verified). 188 `.krn` files carry populated `**fing` spines
  (~65k finger tokens). Fingerings are from 1830s first editions → the fingering
  layer itself is PD; only the encoding needs CC BY attribution. Companion
  `humdrum-polish-scores`, same terms. **Best off-the-shelf fingered source found.**
- **Mutopia Burgmüller Op.100** (`ftp/BurgmullerJFF/O100/25EF-*`) — **Public
  Domain**, ~18 études with genuine LilyPond note-attached fingering (`e8-5`).
  In reach today via the LilyPond reader.
- **LilyPond PD snippets** (`fretted-strings` set) — 31 fragments, genuinely PD
  (the LilyPond README carves `snippets/` out of GFDL/GPL into public domain).
  Tab-notation teaching examples, not repertoire.
- **Cellofun.eu Bach Suites playing edition** (on IMSLP, BWV 1007/1009/1010/1012)
  — fingering + bowing, tagged "PD dedicated" but the site footer says
  "Copyright 2023". **Gated:** confirm the IMSLP uploader is the author, get
  written CC0 confirmation, and open the ZIP to check the markup is encoded (not
  baked into a PDF) before relying on it.

### Disqualified fingered sources (verified)
PIG (academic-only, walled), MAESTRO/ASAP/SMD/Batik/TRIOS (CC BY-**NC**-SA),
Gerbode lute 20k (CC BY-NC-SA), SCORE-SET (CC BY-NC-SA; arXiv metadata *wrongly*
says CC-BY), ECOLM / E-LAUTE / SyncViolinist (no data licence), URMP/Bach10 (no
licence), Suzuki (all-rights + trademark). **Corrections to earlier notes:**
GAPS has **no licence file at all** (not "CC-BY-NC-SA"); PDMX is **CC BY 4.0**,
not CC0 despite the name; MusicNet's Zenodo release is now CC BY 4.0 (pitch only).

### The dead-editor strategy (the general solution, all instruments)
A modern editor's fingering on a PD work is a fresh §2/§70 contribution — but an
editor **dead before 1955** has an EU-clear editorial layer too. So an OMR/vision
pass over a *dead-editor* PD scan yields notes AND authentic period fingerings,
owned outright. Candidates (death year → editorial layer PD): cello — Grützmacher
1903, Klengel 1933, Feuillard 1935; piano — Köhler 1886, Ruthardt 1934; guitar —
19th-c. first editions (Boije scans). Keep a per-score provenance record
(edition, first-publication year, editor death year) as the §70 audit trail —
the DB manifest schema already carries these fields.

### OMR capability audit + a vision-LLM result
- **Our OMR models do NOT emit fingering.** Verified in source: the
  `semantic` / `bekern` / `lilynotes` converters
  (`crisp_notation_cli/lib/omr.dart` + `crisp_notation_core/.../omr/`) contain no
  fingering/technical parsing. They recover pitch + rhythm only. But the target
  model **can hold it** — `NoteElement.fingerings: List<int>`
  (`core/lib/src/model/element.dart:163`) and `TabVoicing` for strings exist.
  So the pipeline can carry fingering the OMR step throws away.
- **A vision-LLM can read the fingerings the OMR model ignores — tested.**
  Rendered Burgmüller Op.100 No.1 to an image, transcribed the right-hand
  fingerings visually, and scored against the LilyPond ground truth:
  **9/9 exact** on the resolvable digits (`5,3,5,5,2,1,3,2,1`). Demo output shape
  in `scratchpad/vtest/bar1_demo.json`, mapping to `NoteElement`.
  **Honest bounds:** this was a *clean computer-engraved* score, not a historical
  lithograph — real scans are materially harder; fingering *digits* read cleanly
  but full pitch/rhythm accuracy is a separate, less-verified question; and
  per-page cost makes it a targeted tool (the repertoire pieces that matter), not
  a bulk harvester. Any output needs a validation pass (round-trips to plausible
  pitches, fingerings make hand-sense) — the same defensive posture that caught
  the year-field and cello-range bugs elsewhere in this effort.

### Bottom line
Ship NIFC (piano, fingered, CC BY) + Burgmüller (piano, fingered, PD) now. For
guitar/cello, the fingered layer must be **built**: either the arranger computes
fret (guitar, already shipping) or a **vision pass over dead-editor PD scans**
recovers real period fingerings. The §2/§3-vs-§70 status of editorial fingering
is genuinely unsettled in German law — a Fachanwalt sign-off is warranted before
a commercial ship relies on any post-1900 editorial layer.
