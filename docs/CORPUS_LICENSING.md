# Freely-licensed music corpora — sourcing & licence findings

Working notes for sourcing bundle-able ("Tier A") song/score/tab data for
CometBeat, a **COMMERCIAL** children's music app shipping in **Germany**.
**NOT legal advice.** Anything commercial-critical wants a Fachanwalt für
Urheberrecht sign-off (§3/§4 UrhG exposure + the axis-2 questions below).

Last updated 2026-07-21. Some leads remain unverified — the research sweep hit
the weekly API limit (resets 07-25) and the VPS holding the downloaded corpus +
`LICENSES.md` was unreachable. Verified vs. pending is marked throughout.

## The test every candidate must pass — TWO axes

A dataset qualifies for **shipping** only if BOTH are clean:

- **Axis 1 — the encoding/transcription licence.** CC0 / CC BY / MIT / ISC = ok;
  CC BY-NC / research-only / unstated = not. (CC BY-SA and the CPDL License are
  ok **but copyleft** — a bundle inherits share-alike.)
- **Axis 2 — the underlying work.** EU term is **life+70**, and for co-written
  works it runs from the **last surviving** author (Term Directive art. 1(6)).
  We ship in Germany, so **US public domain ("published before 1929") is NOT
  sufficient** — many US-PD sources are still protected in the EU.

A CC0 transcription of an in-copyright song is **axis-1 clean, axis-2 fail** —
that split is the trap that sinks most candidates. The two clean shapes are:
(a) a permissive transcription of a **long-PD** work, or (b) audio/notation
**created for the dataset itself** (no third-party work underneath).

## Our import reach — format is rarely the blocker; LICENCE is

App import filters (verified in code, `import_screen.dart` /
`composition_workshop_screen.dart` / `tab_workshop_screen.dart`):

| Format | ext | into |
|---|---|---|
| MusicXML (+zip) | musicxml / xml / mxl | full Score |
| MIDI | mid / midi | full Score |
| ABC | abc | full Score |
| MEI | mei | full Score |
| **Humdrum kern** | krn | full Score (rare in consumer apps — our edge) |
| MuseScore | mscx / mscz | full Score |
| Guitar Pro (GPIF) | gp / gpx | full Score + **tab** |
| ChordPro | cho / pro | chord sheet |
| JAMS | jams | chords + melody |
| ASCII tab | (text) | tab Score |

In-library but **not UI-wired**: `scoreFromSemantic`, `scoreFromLilyNotes` — the
cheapest possible "new filters" (parser exists, only wiring missing). But note
their poster-child corpus (PrIMuS) is licence-blocked, so wire them only when a
cleanly-licensed source in those encodings turns up.

## Two strategic findings

**TABS: don't source them — generate them.** Every large Guitar-Pro corpus is a
scrape of in-copyright songs (DadaGP, ~26k, research-access-only, from Ultimate
Guitar — both axes dirty). BUT we own `arrangeTab` + `gpFretPlanFor` +
`scoreToGpif` + the `tabconv` CLI: we **manufacture playable tab from any
score**. So the tab corpus == the clean score corpus run through our arranger.
Zero third-party tab licensing needed.

**The academic classical corpora are a NonCommercial trap.** The "obvious"
symbolic-classical route (kern/ABC editions of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven) is
almost uniformly CC BY-NC-SA — axis-2 clean, axis-1 fail. Verified across 8
repos below. Reachable, but dev/test only.

| Dataset | Files | Axis 1 | Axis 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| GuitarSet | 360 jams | CC BY 4.0 (Zenodo API) | recorded FOR the dataset — nothing underneath ✅ |
| Harmonix | 912 jams | MIT | beat/segment timestamps only ✅ |
| jams-pkg | 7 jams | ISC | synthetic ✅ |
| OpenEWLD-eu-pd | 87 works / 103 mxl | MIT | author-death filtered to EU-PD ✅ (defensible, not "cleared") |

### New, verified-clean, format-reachable (no new code needed)

| Source | →reach | Axis 1 | Notes / axis-2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenScore Lieder** | MusicXML | **CC0** (LICENSE.txt) | 1,200+ 19th-c. art songs, multi-part + lyrics. **Top pick.** Needs composer+poet death-filter (below). |
| **OpenScore String Quartets** | MusicXML | **CC0** (LICENSE.txt) | Chamber, PD composers. Smaller, same clean profile. |
| **PDMX** (is_original slice) | MusicXML | **CC0**, 7,549 (metadata, offline) | Original amateur compositions. Self-attested → wants a dup pass. |
| **Mutopia** | .ly / MIDI | **CC BY-SA / CC BY / PD — all commercial-OK** (legal.html) | Per-piece licence + editor-rights filter; BY-SA copyleft on a bundle. |
| **CPDL / ChoralWiki** | MusicXML/MXL where offered | **CPDL License = commercial + share-alike** (copyleft); editions also CC / PD | Choral/vocal — strong for a SINGING app. Per-edition filter; §3 engraving + US-PD cautions. |
| **GregoBase** | GABC (needs converter) or its MusicXML export | **CC0** | Gregorian chant; axis-2 trivially clear. Niche for kids. |

**Detail worth keeping:**

- **PDMX** — 254,077 MuseScore scores. The headline "public domain" is mostly the
  **PD Mark** (210,364) — a *claim*, not a grant. Only 43,713 are real **CC0**;
  33,142 of those carry no `license_conflict`. But CC0 covers the ENGRAVING only:
  the clean-CC0 set still contains "Seven Nation Army", "Light of the Seven",
  "Crimson Peak – Edith's Theme" (in-copyright songs, axis-2 fail). The
  `is_original` flag is the axis-2 filter → **CC0 ∧ no-conflict ∧ is_original =
  7,549** clean on both axes. Self-attested, so "defensible", not "cleared".
- **Mutopia** — all three licences permit commercial use. Native guitar `.ly`
  files are mixed: e.g. Aguado Op. 11 No. 6 (`Mutopia-2016/01/15-2097`, CC BY-SA
  4.0, plate-backed to S. Richault 6713.R.) carries sparse editor cues (one
  explicit LilyPond string event `\2`, some left-hand fingerings) and its
  `TabStaff` is commented out ("tabs are not completely developed"). Treat as
  clean score material + sparse string cues, not full tab gold. For our tab
  labeler, LilyPond string-number events (`\1`..`\6`) are the useful labels:
  fret is derivable from note pitch + string. Left-hand finger numbers are only
  auxiliary context.
  Automated scan: `tool/mutopia_guitar_scan.py` against local
  `/Users/christianstrobele/code/mutopia-guitar/manifest.json` downloaded 361
  primary `.ly` sources from 388 guitar entries; 27 derived source URLs were 404.
  Classification: 6 `dense_string_labels`, 20 `weak_string_labels`, 21
  `sparse_string_labels`, 36 `fingering_only`, 84 `tabstaff_score_only`, 194
  `score_only`, 27 `unscanned`. Strongest direct
  string-label candidates are `capricho-arabe` (229 string events),
  `moonlight-guitar-duo` (90), `sym5-1-guitar-duo` (79),
  `wtk1-prelude1-guitar-duo` (73), `claro-de-luna` (69), and
  `sorf_op35_no22` (65). Reports:
  `/Users/christianstrobele/code/mutopia-guitar/reports/mutopia_guitar_ly_scan.{json,csv}`.
  Conclusion: useful, but not GuitarSet-scale gold. Use dense files as direct
  string/fret supervision, weak/sparse string files as lower-weight supervision,
  and score-only pieces for arranger-generated pseudo-label pretraining before
  GuitarSet fine-tuning.

Tabs for **every** row above come free via our own `arrangeTab` — see the tab
finding. So the shippable *tab* corpus is exactly this shippable *score* corpus.

## Tab pipeline — datasets to IMPROVE it (symbolic→tab, audio→tab)

Different goal from bundling: training/eval data to make the tab pipeline
better, not content to ship. Licence logic shifts slightly — for a model shipped
in a commercial app, **CC BY / CC0 = trainable; CC BY-NC = eval/dev only; ND =
can't even derive.** Axis 2 is usually clean here because the audio is recorded
**for** the dataset (no third-party song underneath) — GAPS is the exception
(YouTube-linked real performances).

**The highest-value "improve" move needs no new data — it re-uses GuitarSet as a
BENCHMARK for our arranger.** Every note in GuitarSet's JAMS carries the
string+fret a real guitarist chose. Extract (pitch-sequence → human string/fret),
run our own `arrangeTab` on the same pitches, and measure agreement + playability.
That turns GuitarSet (CC BY 4.0, already on the VPS) from "content" into a
quantified quality metric + regression benchmark for symbolic→tab — the "improve,
not just use" the arranger currently lacks (it has a cost model, no ground truth).

### Datasets (verified via Zenodo API this session)

| Dataset | Zenodo | Licence | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GuitarSet** | 3371780 | **CC BY 4.0** | GOLD. `.jams` w/ note+string+fret ground truth → arranger benchmark AND audio→tab train. Have it. |
| **EGSet12** | 11406378 | **CC BY 4.0** | **`.gp` + `.jams`**, 12 solo electric pieces, **original — composed by the author** (axis-2 clean). Tiny (~6 min) but BOTH-axes clean, both formats we import, real string/fret. ✅ shippable + trainable |
| **Guitar-TECHS** | 14963133 | **CC BY 4.0** (4.1 GB) | electric; techniques + excerpts + chords + scales, diverse hardware. audio→tab + technique. ✅ trainable |
| **AG-PT-set** | 10159492 | **CC BY 4.0** (6.7 GB) | acoustic; 12 playing techniques, onset-labeled (10h). technique detection. ✅ trainable |
| **EGDB (rendered)** | 12674910 | **CC BY 4.0** (1 GB) | 240 electric tracks; tone/effect robustness (FX-removal variant). ✅ trainable |
| **Five guitar dataset** | 4988354 | **CC BY 4.0** | 30 perfs, multi-setup (DI/mobile). ✅ trainable |
| **FiloBass** | 10069709 | **CC BY 4.0** | jazz bass transcriptions — only if we extend to bass. ✅ |
| **ToqueFlamenco** | 804050 | **CC BY 4.0** | flamenco falsetas + MIDI manual transcriptions. ✅ |
| **GAPS (Guitar-Aligned Performance Scores)** | 17152440 | **CC BY-NC-SA** | aligned MIDI + scores + downbeats; THE audio→score set. ❌ NC → eval/dev only, not the shipped model |
| **IDMT-SMT-Guitar** | 7544110 | **CC BY-NC-ND** | classic transcription set; NC **and** ND → ❌ dev/test only |

**For the audio→tab effort** (another agent is on a TabCNN/OMR path — see
`tabcnn_emitter.dart`, `audiveris/`): the CC-BY training expansion of the
GuitarSet-only TabCNN is **Guitar-TECHS + AG-PT-set**. **Do NOT train the
shipped model on GAPS or IDMT-SMT-Guitar** (NC) — use them only to evaluate.

**Fingering (left-hand finger 1–4), not just fret:** GuitarSet gives string+fret
(→ position), from which fingering can be *derived* but is not labelled. No clean
CC-BY explicit-fingering guitar corpus surfaced this pass — flag as a data gap if
the arranger is to output finger numbers, not just frets.

### String/fret ground-truth by FORMAT (the user's question, answered)

Where clean (both-axes) explicit string/fret supervision actually lives, per
format we import. The useful label is **string number** — given pitch + string,
fret is deterministic; left-hand fingering is only auxiliary.

- **`.jams`** — **GuitarSet** (large, CC BY, string+fret) + **EGSet12** (12,
  CC BY, string/fret via its paired `.gp`). That is essentially the entire
  clean JAMS-with-string/fret universe — JAMS guitar annotation is rare, and
  everything else that surfaced was effects/tone (GUITAR-FX, EGFxSet) with no
  fret data, or NC (IDMT).
- **`.gp` (Guitar Pro)** — `.gp` encodes string+fret inherently, but every large
  archive is a UG scrape of in-copyright songs (DadaGP, research-only). The ONLY
  both-axes-clean `.gp` found is **EGSet12** (12 original pieces). So clean `.gp`
  data = EGSet12 + whatever **we generate ourselves** via `scoreToGpif`.
- **`.ly` (LilyPond)** — **Mutopia**, scanned by `tool/mutopia_guitar_scan.py`:
  **47 files with explicit LilyPond string events (`\1`..`\6`), 1,117 events
  total** (6 dense / 20 weak / 21 sparse); densest `capricho-arabe` (229),
  `moonlight-guitar-duo` (90). The 36 `fingering_only` files are NOT string/fret
  labels. This is the main `.ly` string-label source; useful but not
  GuitarSet-scale — dense files as direct supervision, weak/sparse as
  lower-weight, score-only as arranger-pseudo-label pretraining.
- **`.mei`** — **GAP.** MEI's `<tabGrp>` module encodes string+fret+finger
  natively and historical lute/guitar tab is long-PD, but **no accessible CC0/
  CC-BY MEI-tablature *data* corpus surfaced** (the TabMEI org is empty; the lute
  repos found are editors/converters, e.g. ECOLM's `ecolmeditor` (GPL code), not
  licensed encoded corpora). Historical lute tab is also 6-course, non-guitar
  tuning — marginal for a guitar app even if a corpus turned up. Treat `.mei`
  string/fret as not-currently-available rather than promising.

**Net:** the clean string/fret world is small and concentrated — GuitarSet
(`.jams`, the anchor) + EGSet12 (`.gp`+`.jams`) + Mutopia's 47 `.ly` files. This
is *exactly* why the "generate tabs from clean scores via `arrangeTab`" strategy
matters: sourced ground truth alone won't scale a fret/fingering model.

### Tab-labeler model — SHIPPED, and how this corpus work feeds it

The symbolic→tab labeler is built and published: `cstr/tab-labeler-onnx` (HF),
trainer at `onnx_runtime_dart/tool/tab_labeler/{extract,train}.py`, acceptance
gate `test/tab_labeler_accept_test.dart`. It's the "improve the arranger"
direction, done: a tiny CNN scores `(string,fret)` placements so `arrangeTab`'s
Viterbi fingers like a human. Same `[6,21]` contract as the audio→tab TabCNN, so
the shipped decoder consumes both.

**Licence provenance — verified clean.** Trained **only on GuitarSet (CC BY 4.0)**
(`extract.py` reads GuitarSet JAMS; val held out on player 05). HF card is
`license: cc-by-4.0` and attributes GuitarSet verbatim (*"Trained on GuitarSet
(Xi et al., ISMIR 2018, CC BY 4.0) — derived weights redistributable with
attribution. No DadaGP / no request-gated data."*). So the shipped model is
commercial-clean **provided the app carries the GuitarSet attribution** (add it
to the About/licenses registry alongside Bravura OFL).

**Measured result (my run of the promoted `8270` model, 60 held-out songs /
8,715 positions):** human-fingering agreement **56.98% (heuristic) → 82.70%
(model), +25.71 pts**, at ~equal hand movement. The model never emits tab — it
only scores positions the arranger enumerates, so playability invariants hold.

⚠ **Stale model card:** the HF card documents **78.59% (+21.6 pts)** — an earlier
model. The promoted weights (`8270`) now measure **82.70% (+25.71 pts)**. Update
the card, and confirm which weights are actually live on HF (there's a local
`hf-upload-8270` dir).

**How the corpus findings extend it (clean training expansion):**
- **EGSet12** (CC BY 4.0, `.jams`+`.gp`, original) — new clean per-string data
  beyond GuitarSet's 6 players. Tiny, but adds a 7th player/style at zero licence
  cost. Fold into `extract.py`'s GuitarSet glob.
- **Mutopia `.ly`, `non-sa/` only** — the 47 string-labeled files (`tool/
  mutopia_guitar_scan.py`) are **sparse PARTIAL string PINS, not dense per-note
  labels** (guitar staff notation can't carry full string/fret — string marks on
  <½ the notes even at densest). Role: `Score.tabVoicings` pins + arranger
  pseudo-labels, NOT a GuitarSet-grade training set. And the **CC BY-SA subset is
  copyleft** — only `non-sa/` (CC BY / PD) may feed a CC-BY model. See
  `docs/TAB_LABELER_ROADMAP.md` §3 for the dense-vs-sparse data picture.
- **Guitar-TECHS / AG-PT-set (CC BY)** — for the *audio*→tab TabCNN, not this
  symbolic labeler.

### Movement is a TUNABLE knob, not a model property — measured Pareto frontier

The `8270` model raised human-fingering agreement to 82.70% but at **+6.8% hand
movement** vs the heuristic (the `7859` model was +25→+21.6 pts at +3.4%). That
extra movement is NOT baked into the weights: `arrangeTab` is already a Viterbi
DP whose transition term penalises hand travel (`|Δfret|·cost.move`, default
1.0) — the model only replaces the *local* term, so its idiomatic-position
preference just outvotes `cost.move`. Raising that one weight claws movement
back, measured on the 60-song / 8,715-position benchmark (8270 model):

| `cost.move` | agreement | movement | vs heuristic mvmt |
|---|---|---|---|
| heuristic (no model) | 56.98% | 4095 | — |
| 1.0 (shipped) | **82.70%** | 4372 | +6.8% |
| 1.5 | 81.66% | 4251 | +3.8% |
| **2.0 (knee)** | **80.38%** | **4147** | **+1.3%** |
| 3.0 | 79.00% | 4086 | −0.2% |
| 6.0 | 77.06% | 4078 | −0.4% |

**`move≈2.0` keeps 80.4% agreement at near-heuristic movement**, and
**8270@move-2.0 (80.4% / +1.3%) dominates 7859@move-1.0 (78.6% / +3.4%) on both
axes** — so ship 8270 with a higher `cost.move`, archive 7859 as a dominated
fallback. This is a bog-standard result: string-instrument fingering as a
min-cost path over hand-position states is the **Sayegh (1989) "optimum path
paradigm"**, extended by Radicioni & Lombardo, Radisavljevic & Driessen (2004,
learned costs), Barbancho et al. (2012, HMM w/ fingering-difficulty transitions),
and Heijink & Meulenbroek (2002, biomechanical cost). Our emission-model + DP-
transition stack is exactly that family; the model supplies local idiomaticity,
the DP enforces low movement/span globally.

**One caveat — span vs movement differ.** Raising `cost.move` fixes *movement*
(a transition cost). It does NOT bias toward smaller *spans*, because the model
**replaces** the local term where `cost.span` lived — so within the hard span cap
(`kHandSpan=5`) the model picks the shape. To also prefer *narrower* shapes, the
one code change worth making is to keep `cost.span`/`cost.height` in the local
cost **additively** even when the model is present (`local = −modelScore·w +
_localCost(f)`), rather than replacing it. Small, in `arrangeTab`'s `local()`.

## Still unverified

- **RISM open data** — the layer *under* PrIMuS; a possible MEI unlock if its
  incipits carry a clean CC licence. Could NOT verify: rism.online is a JS SPA
  that returns an empty shell to fetchers and hangs on curl; the static
  open-data pages 404. Widely *reputed* CC0, but unconfirmed — do NOT rely on
  memory. **Low priority** anyway: incipits are short fragments, less useful
  than full scores, and the PrIMuS route is licence-blocked regardless.
- (**Meertens resolved → rejected**: **CC BY-NC-SA 3.0** Unported, verbatim from
  liederenbank.nl — *"Meertens Tune Collections by Meertens Instituut is licensed
  under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
  License."* NonCommercial. kern/MIDI/LilyPond, so reachable — but dev/test only.)

(**Essen resolved → rejected**, see table above: CCARH MuseData = NC.)

## The recurring German-law point (from multiple sources, incl. the sites themselves)

Even for a PD tune, a **modern Notensatz / arrangement carries its own fresh
copyright** (§3 UrhG), and a curated collection carries a **database right**
(§4 / §87a-e UrhG). "gemeinfrei" / "GEMA-frei" ≠ "free to bundle". **Lyrics
clear separately** from melody and often later. This is why OpenScore Lieder
needs a composer-**and**-poet death check, and why CPDL/Mutopia need a per-item
filter that also considers the modern editor.

## Recommended next actions (when limits + VPS return)

1. **OpenScore Lieder, death-date filtered** — reuse the OpenEWLD Wikidata filter
   on **both** composer and poet (a sampled 8 Lieder poets all died pre-1948:
   Campbell 1914, Coleridge 1907, Crewe-Milnes 1945, Davidson 1909, Evers 1947,
   Eschelbach 1948, Falke 1916, Fallström 1937 — encouraging, but a sample).
   Highest-value clean growth: CC0 + filterable + real repertoire with lyrics.
2. **PDMX is_original slice** — fetch the 7,549, add a dup/plagiarism pass.
3. **Self-engrave German Kinderlieder** from pre-1900 PD facsimiles (Erk/Böhme
   *Deutscher Liederhort*, Zuccalmaglio) into our own MusicXML via crisp_notation
   — sidesteps every third-party encoding/DB claim, and is the only clean route
   to the German children's-song repertoire the app actually wants.
4. Fetch the CC-BY tab-training sets (Guitar-TECHS 14963133, AG-PT-set 10159492)
   and build the GuitarSet arranger-benchmark (see tab-pipeline section).
5. rsync the corpus off `/mnt/volume1` (VPS-local, not backed up) to
   `/mnt/storage`.

## Preserving fingering/fret/bowing — the performance layer (2026-07-21)

Regenerating fingering algorithmically loses the human choice, so sources that
*retain* it are worth more. Structural finding across a five-instrument sweep:
**no openly-licensed corpus is simultaneously (a) at scale, (b) clean for a
commercial EU/German ship, and (c) carries a real string/fret/finger/bow layer.**
The layer must be **authored, or taken from a dead-editor source**, never
harvested from a modern edition.

### Sources that DO carry fingering and are shippable
- **NIFC Chopin First Editions** — `github.com/pl-wnifc/humdrum-chopin-first-editions`,
  **CC BY 4.0** (verified). 188 `.krn` files carry populated `**fing` spines
  (~65k finger tokens). Fingerings are from 1830s first editions → the fingering
  layer itself is PD; only the encoding needs CC BY attribution. Companion
  `humdrum-polish-scores`, same terms. **Best off-the-shelf fingered source found.**
- **Mutopia Burgmüller Op.100** (`ftp/BurgmullerJFF/O100/25EF-*`) — **Public
  Domain**, ~18 études with genuine LilyPond note-attached fingering (`e8-5`).
  In reach today via the LilyPond reader.
- **LilyPond PD snippets** (`fretted-strings` set) — 31 fragments, genuinely PD
  (the LilyPond README carves `snippets/` out of GFDL/GPL into public domain).
  Tab-notation teaching examples, not repertoire.
- **Cellofun.eu Bach Suites playing edition** (on IMSLP, BWV 1007/1009/1010/1012)
  — fingering + bowing, tagged "PD dedicated" but the site footer says
  "Copyright 2023". **Gated:** confirm the IMSLP uploader is the author, get
  written CC0 confirmation, and open the ZIP to check the markup is encoded (not
  baked into a PDF) before relying on it.

### Disqualified fingered sources (verified)
PIG (academic-only, walled), MAESTRO/ASAP/SMD/Batik/TRIOS (CC BY-**NC**-SA),
Gerbode lute 20k (CC BY-NC-SA), SCORE-SET (CC BY-NC-SA; arXiv metadata *wrongly*
says CC-BY), ECOLM / E-LAUTE / SyncViolinist (no data licence), URMP/Bach10 (no
licence), Suzuki (all-rights + trademark). **Corrections to earlier notes:**
GAPS has **no licence file at all** (not "CC-BY-NC-SA"); PDMX is **CC BY 4.0**,
not CC0 despite the name; MusicNet's Zenodo release is now CC BY 4.0 (pitch only).

### The dead-editor strategy (the general solution, all instruments)
A modern editor's fingering on a PD work is a fresh §2/§70 contribution — but an
editor **dead before 1955** has an EU-clear editorial layer too. So an OMR/vision
pass over a *dead-editor* PD scan yields notes AND authentic period fingerings,
owned outright. Candidates (death year → editorial layer PD): cello — Grützmacher
1903, Klengel 1933, Feuillard 1935; piano — Köhler 1886, Ruthardt 1934; guitar —
19th-c. first editions (Boije scans). Keep a per-score provenance record
(edition, first-publication year, editor death year) as the §70 audit trail —
the DB manifest schema already carries these fields.

### OMR capability audit + a vision-LLM result
- **Our OMR models do NOT emit fingering.** Verified in source: the
  `semantic` / `bekern` / `lilynotes` converters
  (`crisp_notation_cli/lib/omr.dart` + `crisp_notation_core/.../omr/`) contain no
  fingering/technical parsing. They recover pitch + rhythm only. But the target
  model **can hold it** — `NoteElement.fingerings: List<int>`
  (`core/lib/src/model/element.dart:163`) and `TabVoicing` for strings exist.
  So the pipeline can carry fingering the OMR step throws away.
- **A vision-LLM can read the fingerings the OMR model ignores — tested.**
  Rendered Burgmüller Op.100 No.1 to an image, transcribed the right-hand
  fingerings visually, and scored against the LilyPond ground truth:
  **9/9 exact** on the resolvable digits (`5,3,5,5,2,1,3,2,1`). Demo output shape
  in `scratchpad/vtest/bar1_demo.json`, mapping to `NoteElement`.
  **Honest bounds:** this was a *clean computer-engraved* score, not a historical
  lithograph — real scans are materially harder; fingering *digits* read cleanly
  but full pitch/rhythm accuracy is a separate, less-verified question; and
  per-page cost makes it a targeted tool (the repertoire pieces that matter), not
  a bulk harvester. Any output needs a validation pass (round-trips to plausible
  pitches, fingerings make hand-sense) — the same defensive posture that caught
  the year-field and cello-range bugs elsewhere in this effort.

### Bottom line
Ship NIFC (piano, fingered, CC BY) + Burgmüller (piano, fingered, PD) now. For
guitar/cello, the fingered layer must be **built**: either the arranger computes
fret (guitar, already shipping) or a **vision pass over dead-editor PD scans**
recovers real period fingerings. The §2/§3-vs-§70 status of editorial fingering
is genuinely unsettled in German law — a Fachanwalt sign-off is warranted before
a commercial ship relies on any post-1900 editorial layer.
